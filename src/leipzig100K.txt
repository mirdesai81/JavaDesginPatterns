it was the best of times it was the worst of times
it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness
it was the epoch of belief it was the epoch of incredulity
it was the season of light it was the season of darkness
it was the spring of hope it was the winter of despair
we had everything before us we had nothing before us
we were all going direct to heaven we were all going direct
the other wayin short the period was so far like the present
period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its
being received for good or for evil in the superlative degree
of comparison only

there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face
on the throne of england there were a king with a large jaw and
a queen with a fair face on the throne of france  in both
countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the state
preserves of loaves and fishes that things in general were
settled for ever

it was the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and
seventyfive  spiritual revelations were conceded to england at
that favoured period as at this  mrs southcott had recently
attained her fiveandtwentieth blessed birthday of whom a
prophetic private in the life guards had heralded the sublime
appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the
swallowing up of london and westminster  even the cocklane
ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years after rapping
out its messages as the spirits of this very year last past
supernaturally deficient in originality rapped out theirs
mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to
the english crown and people from a congress of british subjects
in america  which strange to relate have proved more important
to the human race than any communications yet received through
any of the chickens of the cocklane brood

france less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than
her sister of the shield and trident rolled with exceeding
smoothness down hill making paper money and spending it
under the guidance of her christian pastors she entertained
herself besides with such humane achievements as sentencing
a youth to have his hands cut off his tongue torn out with
pincers and his body burned alive because he had not kneeled
down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
which passed within his view at a distance of some fifty or
sixty yards  it is likely enough that rooted in the woods of
france and norway there were growing trees when that sufferer
was put to death already marked by the woodman fate to come
down and be sawn into boards to make a certain movable framework
with a sack and a knife in it terrible in history  it is likely
enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy
lands adjacent to paris there were sheltered from the weather
that very day rude carts bespattered with rustic mire snuffed
about by pigs and roosted in by poultry which the farmer death
had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the revolution
but that woodman and that farmer though they work unceasingly
work silently and no one heard them as they went about with
muffled tread  the rather forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
that they were awake was to be atheistical and traitorous

in england there was scarcely an amount of order and protection
to justify much national boasting  daring burglaries by armed
men and highway robberies took place in the capital itself
every night families were publicly cautioned not to go out of
town without removing their furniture to upholsterers warehouses
for security the highwayman in the dark was a city tradesman in
the light and being recognised and challenged by his fellow
tradesman whom he stopped in his character of the captain
gallantly shot him through the head and rode away the mail was
waylaid by seven robbers and the guard shot three dead and then
got shot dead himself by the other four in consequence of the
failure of his ammunition after which the mail was robbed in
peace that magnificent potentate the lord mayor of london was
made to stand and deliver on turnham green by one highwayman
who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his
retinue prisoners in london gaols fought battles with their
turnkeys and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among
them loaded with rounds of shot and ball thieves snipped off
diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at court
drawingrooms musketeers went into st giless to search for
contraband goods and the mob fired on the musketeers and the
musketeers fired on the mob and nobody thought any of these
occurrences much out of the common way  in the midst of them
the hangman ever busy and ever worse than useless was in
constant requisition now stringing up long rows of miscellaneous
criminals now hanging a housebreaker on saturday who had been
taken on tuesday now burning people in the hand at newgate by
the dozen and now burning pamphlets at the door of westminster hall
today taking the life of an atrocious murderer and tomorrow of a
wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmers boy of sixpence

all these things and a thousand like them came to pass in
and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred
and seventyfive  environed by them while the woodman and the
farmer worked unheeded those two of the large jaws and those
other two of the plain and the fair faces trod with stir enough
and carried their divine rights with a high hand  thus did the
year one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive conduct their
greatnesses and myriads of small creaturesthe creatures of this
chronicle among the restalong the roads that lay before them



ii

the mail


it was the dover road that lay on a friday night late in november
before the first of the persons with whom this history has business
the dover road lay as to him beyond the dover mail as it lumbered
up shooters hill  he walked up hill in the mire by the side of the
mail as the rest of the passengers did not because they had the
least relish for walking exercise under the circumstances but
because the hill and the harness and the mud and the mail were
all so heavy that the horses had three times already come to a stop
besides once drawing the coach across the road with the mutinous
intent of taking it back to blackheath  reins and whip and coachman
and guard however in combination had read that article of war
which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument
that some brute animals are endued with reason and the team had
capitulated and returned to their duty

with drooping heads and tremulous tails they mashed their way
through the thick mud floundering and stumbling between whiles
as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints  as often
as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand with a
wary woho sohothen the near leader violently shook his
head and everything upon itlike an unusually emphatic horse
denying that the coach could be got up the hill  whenever the
leader made this rattle the passenger started as a nervous
passenger might and was disturbed in mind

there was a steaming mist in all the hollows and it had roamed
in its forlornness up the hill like an evil spirit seeking rest
and finding none  a clammy and intensely cold mist it made its
slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and
overspread one another as the waves of an unwholesome sea might
do  it was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of
the coachlamps but these its own workings and a few yards of
road and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it as if
they had made it all

two other passengers besides the one were plodding up the hill
by the side of the mail  all three were wrapped to the cheekbones
and over the ears and wore jackboots  not one of the three
could have said from anything he saw what either of the other
two was like and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers
from the eyes of the mind as from the eyes of the body of his
two companions  in those days travellers were very shy of being
confidential on a short notice for anybody on the road might be
a robber or in league with robbers  as to the latter when every
postinghouse and alehouse could produce somebody in the captains
pay ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable nondescript
it was the likeliest thing upon the cards  so the guard of the
dover mail thought to himself that friday night in november one
thousand seven hundred and seventyfive lumbering up shooters
hill as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail
beating his feet and keeping an eye and a hand on the armchest
before him where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or
eight loaded horsepistols deposited on a substratum of cutlass

the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard
suspected the passengers the passengers suspected one another
and the guard they all suspected everybody else and the coachman
was sure of nothing but the horses as to which cattle he could
with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two testaments
that they were not fit for the journey

woho said the coachman  so then  one more pull and youre
at the top and be damned to you for i have had trouble enough to
get you to itjoe

halloa the guard replied

what oclock do you make it joe

ten minutes good past eleven

my blood ejaculated the vexed coachman and not atop of
shooters yet  tst  yah  get on with you

the emphatic horse cut short by the whip in a most decided
negative made a decided scramble for it and the three other
horses followed suit  once more the dover mail struggled on
with the jackboots of its passengers squashing along by its
side  they had stopped when the coach stopped and they kept
close company with it  if any one of the three had had the
hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into
the mist and darkness he would have put himself in a fair way
of getting shot instantly as a highwayman

the last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill
the horses stopped to breathe again and the guard got down to
skid the wheel for the descent and open the coachdoor to let
the passengers in

tst  joe cried the coachman in a warning voice looking down
from his box

what do you say tom

they both listened

i say a horse at a canter coming up joe

i say a horse at a gallop tom returned the guard leaving
his hold of the door and mounting nimbly to his place
gentlemen  in the kings name all of you

with this hurried adjuration he cocked his blunderbuss and
stood on the offensive

the passenger booked by this history was on the coachstep
getting in the two other passengers were close behind him and
about to follow  he remained on the step half in the coach and
half out of they remained in the road below him  they all
looked from the coachman to the guard and from the guard to the
coachman and listened  the coachman looked back and the guard
looked back and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and
looked back without contradicting

the stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and
labouring of the coach added to the stillness of the night made
it very quiet indeed  the panting of the horses communicated a
tremulous motion to the coach as if it were in a state of
agitation  the hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps
to be heard but at any rate the quiet pause was audibly
expressive of people out of breath and holding the breath and
having the pulses quickened by expectation

the sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill

soho the guard sang out as loud as he could roar  yo there
stand  i shall fire

the pace was suddenly checked and with much splashing and floundering
a mans voice called from the mist is that the dover mail

never you mind what it is the guard retorted  what are you

is that the dover mail

why do you want to know

i want a passenger if it is

what passenger

mr jarvis lorry

our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name
the guard the coachman and the two other passengers eyed him
distrustfully

keep where you are the guard called to the voice in the mist
because if i should make a mistake it could never be set right
in your lifetime  gentleman of the name of lorry answer straight

what is the matter asked the passenger then with mildly
quavering speech  who wants me  is it jerry

i dont like jerrys voice if it is jerry growled the guard
to himself  hes hoarser than suits me is jerry

yes mr lorry

what is the matter

a despatch sent after you from over yonder  t and co

i know this messenger guard said mr lorry getting down into
the roadassisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the
other two passengers who immediately scrambled into the coach
shut the door and pulled up the window  he may come close
theres nothing wrong

i hope there aint but i cant make so nation sure of that
said the guard in gruff soliloquy  hallo you

well  and hallo you said jerry more hoarsely than before

come on at a footpace dye mind me  and if youve got holsters
to that saddle o yourn dont let me see your hand go nigh em
for im a devil at a quick mistake and when i make one it takes
the form of lead  so now lets look at you

the figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying
mist and came to the side of the mail where the passenger stood
the rider stooped and casting up his eyes at the guard handed
the passenger a small folded paper  the riders horse was blown
and both horse and rider were covered with mud from the hoofs of
the horse to the hat of the man

guard said the passenger in a tone of quiet business confidence

the watchful guard with his right hand at the stock of his raised
blunderbuss his left at the barrel and his eye on the horseman
answered curtly sir

there is nothing to apprehend  i belong to tellsons bank
you must know tellsons bank in london  i am going to paris
on business  a crown to drink  i may read this

if so be as youre quick sir

he opened it in the light of the coachlamp on that side
and readfirst to himself and then aloud  wait at dover for
mamselle its not long you see guard  jerry say that my
answer was recalled to life

jerry started in his saddle  thats a blazing strange answer too
said he at his hoarsest

take that message back and they will know that i received this
as well as if i wrote  make the best of your way  good night

with those words the passenger opened the coachdoor and got in
not at all assisted by his fellowpassengers who had
expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots
and were now making a general pretence of being asleep  with no
more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating
any other kind of action

the coach lumbered on again with heavier wreaths of mist closing
round it as it began the descent  the guard soon replaced his
blunderbuss in his armchest and having looked to the rest of its
contents and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore
in his belt looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat in which
there were a few smiths tools a couple of torches and a tinderbox
for he was furnished with that completeness that if the coachlamps
had been blown and stormed out which did occasionally happen he had
only to shut himself up inside keep the flint and steel sparks well
off the straw and get a light with tolerable safety and ease if he
were lucky in five minutes

tom softly over the coach roof

hallo joe

did you hear the message

i did joe

what did you make of it tom

nothing at all joe

thats a coincidence too the guard mused for i made the
same of it myself

jerry left alone in the mist and darkness dismounted meanwhile
not only to ease his spent horse but to wipe the mud from his
face and shake the wet out of his hatbrim which might be
capable of holding about half a gallon  after standing with the
bridle over his heavilysplashed arm until the wheels of the
mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still
again he turned to walk down the hill

after that there gallop from temple bar old lady i wont trust
your forelegs till i get you on the level said this hoarse
messenger glancing at his mare  recalled to life  thats a
blazing strange message  much of that wouldnt do for you jerry
i say jerry  youd be in a blazing bad way if recalling to life
was to come into fashion jerry

the night shadows


a wonderful fact to reflect upon that every human creature is
constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other
a solemn consideration when i enter a great city by night that
every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret
that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret that
every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there
is in some of its imaginings a secret to the heart nearest it
something of the awfulness even of death itself is referable to
this  no more can i turn the leaves of this dear book that i loved
and vainly hope in time to read it all  no more can i look into the
depths of this unfathomable water wherein as momentary lights
glanced into it i have had glimpses of buried treasure and other
things submerged  it was appointed that the book should shut with
a spring for ever and for ever when i had read but a page  it was
appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost when
the light was playing on its surface and i stood in ignorance on the
shore  my friend is dead my neighbour is dead my love the darling
of my soul is dead it is the inexorable consolidation and
perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality
and which i shall carry in mine to my lifes end  in any of the
burialplaces of this city through which i pass is there a sleeper
more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are in their innermost
personality to me or than i am to them

as to this his natural and not to be alienated inheritance
the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as
the king the first minister of state or the richest merchant
in london  so with the three passengers shut up in the narrow
compass of one lumbering old mail coach they were mysteries to
one another as complete as if each had been in his own coach and
six or his own coach and sixty with the breadth of a county
between him and the next

the messenger rode back at an easy trot stopping pretty often at
alehouses by the way to drink but evincing a tendency to keep his
own counsel and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes  he had eyes
that assorted very well with that decoration being of a surface
black with no depth in the colour or form and much too near
togetheras if they were afraid of being found out in something
singly if they kept too far apart  they had a sinister expression
under an old cockedhat like a threecornered spittoon and over a
great muffler for the chin and throat which descended nearly to the
wearers knees  when he stopped for drink he moved this muffler
with his left hand only while he poured his liquor in with his
right as soon as that was done he muffled again

no jerry no said the messenger harping on one theme as he rode
it wouldnt do for you jerry  jerry you honest tradesman it
wouldnt suit your line of business  recalled  bust me if i
dont think hed been a drinking

his message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain
several times to take off his hat to scratch his head  except on
the crown which was raggedly bald he had stiff black hair
standing jaggedly all over it and growing down hill almost to his
broad blunt nose  it was so like smiths work so much more like
the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair that the best
of players at leapfrog might have declined him as the most
dangerous man in the world to go over

while he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night
watchman in his box at the door of tellsons bank by temple bar who
was to deliver it to greater authorities within the shadows of the
night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message and took
such shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of
uneasiness  they seemed to be numerous for she shied at every
shadow on the road

what time the mailcoach lumbered jolted rattled and bumped upon
its tedious way with its three fellowinscrutables inside  to whom
likewise the shadows of the night revealed themselves in the forms
their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested

tellsons bank had a run upon it in the mail  as the bank passenger
with an arm drawn through the leathern strap which did what lay in
it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger and driving
him into his corner whenever the coach got a special joltnodded in
his place with halfshut eyes the little coachwindows and the
coachlamp dimly gleaming through them and the bulky bundle of
opposite passenger became the bank and did a great stroke of business
the rattle of the harness was the chink of money and more drafts
were honoured in five minutes than even tellsons with all its
foreign and home connection ever paid in thrice the time  then the
strongrooms underground at tellsons with such of their valuable
stores and secrets as were known to the passenger and it was not a
little that he knew about them opened before him and he went in
among them with the great keys and the feeblyburning candle and
found them safe and strong and sound and still just as he had
last seen them

but though the bank was almost always with him and though the coach
in a confused way like the presence of pain under an opiate was
always with him there was another current of impression that never
ceased to run all through the night  he was on his way to dig some
one out of a grave

now which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before
him was the true face of the buried person the shadows of the night
did not indicate but they were all the faces of a man of fiveand
forty by years and they differed principally in the passions they
expressed and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state
pride contempt defiance stubbornness submission lamentation
succeeded one another so did varieties of sunken cheek cadaverous
colour emaciated hands and figures  but the face was in the main
one face and every head was prematurely white  a hundred times the
dozing passenger inquired of this spectre

buried how long

the answer was always the same  almost eighteen years

you had abandoned all hope of being dug out

long ago

you know that you are recalled to life

they tell me so

i hope you care to live

i cant say

shall i show her to you  will you come and see her

the answers to this question were various and contradictory
sometimes the broken reply was wait  it would kill me if i saw
her too soon  sometimes it was given in a tender rain of tears
and then it was take me to her  sometimes it was staring and
bewildered and then it was i dont know her  i dont understand

after such imaginary discourse the passenger in his fancy would dig
and dig dignow with a spade now with a great key now with his
handsto dig this wretched creature out  got out at last with
earth hanging about his face and hair he would suddenly fan away to
dust  the passenger would then start to himself and lower the
window to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek

yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain on the
moving patch of light from the lamps and the hedge at the roadside
retreating by jerks the night shadows outside the coach would fall
into the train of the night shadows within  the real bankinghouse
by temple bar the real business of the past day the real strong
rooms the real express sent after him and the real message returned
would all be there  out of the midst of them the ghostly face would
rise and he would accost it again

buried how long

almost eighteen years

i hope you care to live

i cant say

digdigdiguntil an impatient movement from one of the two
passengers would admonish him to pull up the window draw his arm
securely through the leathern strap and speculate upon the two
slumbering forms until his mind lost its hold of them and they
again slid away into the bank and the grave

buried how long

almost eighteen years

you had abandoned all hope of being dug out

long ago

the words were still in his hearing as just spokendistinctly in his
hearing as ever spoken words had been in his lifewhen the weary
passenger started to the consciousness of daylight and found that
the shadows of the night were gone

he lowered the window and looked out at the rising sun  there was a
ridge of ploughed land with a plough upon it where it had been left
last night when the horses were unyoked beyond a quiet coppicewood
in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
upon the trees  though the earth was cold and wet the sky was
clear and the sun rose bright placid and beautiful

eighteen years said the passenger looking at the sun
gracious creator of day  to be buried alive for eighteen years



iv

the preparation


when the mail got successfully to dover in the course of the
forenoon the head drawer at the royal george hotel opened the
coachdoor as his custom was  he did it with some flourish of
ceremony for a mail journey from london in winter was an achievement
to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon

by that time there was only one adventurous traveller left be
congratulated  for the two others had been set down at their
respective roadside destinations  the mildewy inside of the coach
with its damp and dirty straw its disagreeable smell and its
obscurity was rather like a larger dogkennel  mr lorry the
passenger shaking himself out of it in chains of straw a tangle of
shaggy wrapper flapping hat and muddy legs was rather like a
larger sort of dog

there will be a packet to calais tomorrow drawer

yes sir if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair
the tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon
sir  bed sir

i shall not go to bed till night but i want a bedroom and a barber

and then breakfast sir  yes sir  that way sir if you please
show concord  gentlemans valise and hot water to concord  pull off
gentlemans boots in concord  you will find a fine seacoal fire
sir  fetch barber to concord  stir about there now for concord

the concord bedchamber being always assigned to a passenger by the
mail and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from
head to foot the room had the odd interest for the establishment of
the royal george that although but one kind of man was seen to go
into it all kinds and varieties of men came out of it  consequently
another drawer and two porters and several maids and the landlady
were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between
the concord and the coffeeroom when a gentleman of sixty formally
dressed in a brown suit of clothes pretty well worn but very well
kept with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets passed
along on his way to his breakfast

the coffeeroom had no other occupant that forenoon than the
gentleman in brown  his breakfasttable was drawn before the fire
and as he sat with its light shining on him waiting for the meal
he sat so still that he might have been sitting for his portrait

very orderly and methodical he looked with a hand on each knee and
a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat
as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
evanescence of the brisk fire  he had a good leg and was a little
vain of it for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close and were
of a fine texture his shoes and buckles too though plain were
trim  he wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig setting very
close to his head  which wig it is to be presumed was made of hair
but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of
silk or glass  his linen though not of a fineness in accordance
with his stockings was as white as the tops of the waves that broke
upon the neighbouring beach or the specks of sail that glinted in
the sunlight far at sea  a face habitually suppressed and quieted
was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright
eyes that it must have cost their owner in years gone by some pains
to drill to the composed and reserved expression of tellsons bank
he had a healthy colour in his cheeks and his face though lined
bore few traces of anxiety  but perhaps the confidential bachelor
clerks in tellsons bank were principally occupied with the cares of
other people and perhaps secondhand cares like secondhand
clothes come easily off and on

completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait
mr lorry dropped off to sleep  the arrival of his breakfast roused
him and he said to the drawer as he moved his chair to it

i wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at
any time today  she may ask for mr jarvis lorry or she may only
ask for a gentleman from tellsons bank  please to let me know

yes sir  tellsons bank in london sir

yes

yes sir  we have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen
in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt london and paris
sir  a vast deal of travelling sir in tellson and companys house

yes  we are quite a french house as well as an english one

yes sir  not much in the habit of such travelling yourself
i think sir

not of late years  it is fifteen years since wesince icame
last from france

indeed sir  that was before my time here sir  before our peoples
time here sir  the george was in other hands at that time sir

i believe so

but i would hold a pretty wager sir that a house like tellson and
company was flourishing a matter of fifty not to speak of fifteen
years ago

you might treble that and say a hundred and fifty yet not be far
from the truth

indeed sir

rounding his mouth and both his eyes as he stepped backward from the
table the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left
dropped into a comfortable attitude and stood surveying the guest
while he ate and drank as from an observatory or watchtower
according to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages

when mr lorry had finished his breakfast he went out for a stroll
on the beach  the little narrow crooked town of dover hid itself
away from the beach and ran its head into the chalk cliffs like a
marine ostrich  the beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones
tumbling wildly about and the sea did what it liked and what it
liked was destruction  it thundered at the town and thundered at
the cliffs and brought the coast down madly  the air among the
houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have
supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it as sick people went
down to be dipped in the sea  a little fishing was done in the port
and a quantity of strolling about by night and looking seaward
particularly at those times when the tide made and was near flood
small tradesmen who did no business whatever sometimes unaccountably
realised large fortunes and it was remarkable that nobody in the
neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter

as the day declined into the afternoon and the air which had been
at intervals clear enough to allow the french coast to be seen
became again charged with mist and vapour mr lorrys thoughts
seemed to cloud too  when it was dark and he sat before the
coffeeroom fire awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast
his mind was busily digging digging digging in the live red coals

a bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals
no harm otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of
work  mr lorry had been idle a long time and had just poured out
his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of
satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a
fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle when a rattling
of wheels came up the narrow street and rumbled into the innyard

he set down his glass untouched  this is mamselle said he

in a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that miss
manette had arrived from london and would be happy to see the
gentleman from tellsons

so soon

miss manette had taken some refreshment on the road and required
none then and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from
tellsons immediately if it suited his pleasure and convenience

the gentleman from tellsons had nothing left for it but to empty his
glass with an air of stolid desperation settle his odd little flaxen
wig at the ears and follow the waiter to miss manettes apartment
it was a large dark room furnished in a funereal manner with black
horsehair and loaded with heavy dark tables  these had been oiled
and oiled until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of
the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf as if they were
buried in deep graves of black mahogany and no light to speak of
could be expected from them until they were dug out

the obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that mr lorry
picking his way over the wellworn turkey carpet supposed
miss manette to be for the moment in some adjacent room until
having got past the two tall candles he saw standing to receive him
by the table between them and the fire a young lady of not more than
seventeen in a ridingcloak and still holding her straw travelling
hat by its ribbon in her hand  as his eyes rested on a short slight
pretty figure a quantity of golden hair a pair of blue eyes that
met his own with an inquiring look and a forehead with a singular
capacity remembering how young and smooth it was of rifting and
knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity
or wonder or alarm or merely of a bright fixed attention though it
included all the four expressionsas his eyes rested on these things
a sudden vivid likeness passed before him of a child whom he had
held in his arms on the passage across that very channel one cold
time when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high  the
likeness passed away like a breath along the surface of the gaunt
pierglass behind her on the frame of which a hospital procession
of negro cupids several headless and all cripples were offering
black baskets of dead sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine
genderand he made his formal bow to miss manette

pray take a seat sir  in a very clear and pleasant young voice
a little foreign in its accent but a very little indeed

i kiss your hand miss said mr lorry with the manners of an
earlier date as he made his formal bow again and took his seat

i received a letter from the bank sir yesterday informing me that
some intelligenceor discovery

the word is not material miss either word will do

respecting the small property of my poor father whom i never
sawso long dead

mr lorry moved in his chair and cast a troubled look towards the
hospital procession of negro cupids  as if they had any help for
anybody in their absurd baskets

rendered it necessary that i should go to paris there to
communicate with a gentleman of the bank so good as to be despatched
to paris for the purpose

myself

as i was prepared to hear sir

she curtseyed to him young ladies made curtseys in those days with
a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and
wiser he was than she  he made her another bow

i replied to the bank sir that as it was considered necessary by
those who know and who are so kind as to advise me that i should go
to france and that as i am an orphan and have no friend who could go
with me i should esteem it highly if i might be permitted to place
myself during the journey under that worthy gentlemans protection
the gentleman had left london but i think a messenger was sent after
him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here

i was happy said mr lorry to be entrusted with the charge
i shall be more happy to execute it

sir i thank you indeed  i thank you very gratefully  it was told
me by the bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of
the business and that i must prepare myself to find them of a
surprising nature  i have done my best to prepare myself and i
naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are

naturally said mr lorry  yesi

after a pause he added again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears
it is very difficult to begin

he did not begin but in his indecision met her glance  the young
forehead lifted itself into that singular expressionbut it was
pretty and characteristic besides being singularand she raised
her hand as if with an involuntary action she caught at or stayed
some passing shadow

are you quite a stranger to me sir

am i not  mr lorry opened his hands and extended them outwards
with an argumentative smile

between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose the line
of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be the
expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the
chair by which she had hitherto remained standing  he watched her as
she mused and the moment she raised her eyes again went on

in your adopted country i presume i cannot do better than address
you as a young english lady miss manette

if you please sir

miss manette i am a man of business  i have a business charge to
acquit myself of  in your reception of it dont heed me any more
than if i was a speaking machinetruly i am not much else  i will
with your leave relate to you miss the story of one of our
customers

story

he seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated when he
added in a hurry yes customers in the banking business we
usually call our connection our customers  he was a french
gentleman a scientific gentleman a man of great acquirementsa
doctor

not of beauvais

why yes of beauvais  like monsieur manette your father
the gentleman was of beauvais  like monsieur manette your father
the gentleman was of repute in paris  i had the honour of knowing
him there  our relations were business relations but confidential
i was at that time in our french house and had beenoh twenty years

at that timei may ask at what time sir

i speak miss of twenty years ago  he marriedan english
ladyand i was one of the trustees  his affairs like the affairs
of many other french gentlemen and french families were entirely in
tellsons hands  in a similar way i am or i have been trustee of
one kind or other for scores of our customers  these are mere business
relations miss there is no friendship in them no particular
interest nothing like sentiment  i have passed from one to another
in the course of my business life just as i pass from one of our
customers to another in the course of my business day in short i
have no feelings i am a mere machine  to go on

but this is my fathers story sir and i begin to think
the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon himthat
when i was left an orphan through my mothers surviving my father
only two years it was you who brought me to england  i am almost
sure it was you

mr lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced
to take his and he put it with some ceremony to his lips  he then
conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again and holding
the chairback with his left hand and using his right by turns to
rub his chin pull his wig at the ears or point what he said stood
looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his

miss manette it was i  and you will see how truly i spoke of
myself just now in saying i had no feelings and that all the
relations i hold with my fellowcreatures are mere business
relations when you reflect that i have never seen you since
no you have been the ward of tellsons house since and i have been
busy with the other business of tellsons house since  feelings
i have no time for them no chance of them  i pass my whole life
miss in turning an immense pecuniary mangle

after this odd description of his daily routine of employment mr
lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands which
was most unnecessary for nothing could be flatter than its shining
surface was before and resumed his former attitude

so far miss as you have remarked this is the story of your
regretted father  now comes the difference  if your father had not
died when he diddont be frightened  how you start

she did indeed start  and she caught his wrist with both her hands

pray said mr lorry in a soothing tone bringing his left hand
from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that
clasped him in so violent a tremble  pray control your agitationa
matter of business  as i was saying

her look so discomposed him that he stopped wandered and began anew

as i was saying if monsieur manette had not died if he had
suddenly and silently disappeared if he had been spirited away
if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place though
no art could trace him if he had an enemy in some compatriot who
could exercise a privilege that i in my own time have known the boldest
people afraid to speak of in a whisper across the water there for
instance the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment
of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time if his
wife had implored the king the queen the court the clergy for any
tidings of him and all quite in vainthen the history of your father
would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman the doctor
of beauvais

i entreat you to tell me more sir

i will  i am going to  you can bear it

i can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment

you speak collectedly and youare collected  thats good
though his manner was less satisfied than his words a matter of
business  regard it as a matter of businessbusiness that must be
done  now if this doctors wife though a lady of great courage and
spirit had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little
child was born

the little child was a daughter sir

a daughter  aamatter of businessdont be distressed  miss
if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child
was born that she came to the determination of sparing the poor
child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the
pains of by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead
no dont kneel  in heavens name why should you kneel to me

for the truth  o dear good compassionate sir for the truth

aa matter of business  you confuse me and how can i transact
business if i am confused  let us be clearheaded  if you could
kindly mention now for instance what nine times ninepence are
or how many shillings in twenty guineas it would be so encouraging
i should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind

without directly answering to this appeal she sat so still when
he had very gently raised her and the hands that had not ceased
to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been
that she communicated some reassurance to mr jarvis lorry

thats right thats right  courage  business  you have business
before you useful business  miss manette your mother took this
course with you  and when she diedi believe brokenhearted
having never slackened her unavailing search for your father
she left you at two years old to grow to be blooming beautiful
and happy without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty
whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison or wasted
there through many lingering years

as he said the words he looked down with an admiring pity on the
flowing golden hair as if he pictured to himself that it might have
been already tinged with grey

you know that your parents had no great possession and that what
they had was secured to your mother and to you  there has been no
new discovery of money or of any other property but

he felt his wrist held closer and he stopped  the expression in the
forehead which had so particularly attracted his notice and which
was now immovable had deepened into one of pain and horror

but he has beenbeen found  he is alive  greatly changed it is
too probable almost a wreck it is possible though we will hope the
best  still alive  your father has been taken to the house of an
old servant in paris and we are going there  i to identify him if
i can  you to restore him to life love duty rest comfort

a shiver ran through her frame and from it through his  she said
in a low distinct awestricken voice as if she were saying it in a
dream

i am going to see his ghost  it will be his ghostnot him

mr lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm  there there
there  see now see now  the best and the worst are known to you now
you are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman and with a fair
sea voyage and a fair land journey you will be soon at his dear side

she repeated in the same tone sunk to a whisper i have been free
i have been happy yet his ghost has never haunted me

only one thing more said mr lorry laying stress upon it as a
wholesome means of enforcing her attention  he has been found under
another name his own long forgotten or long concealed  it would be
worse than useless now to inquire which worse than useless to seek
to know whether he has been for years overlooked or always designedly
held prisoner  it would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries
because it would be dangerous  better not to mention the subject
anywhere or in any way and to remove himfor a while at all events
out of france  even i safe as an englishman and even tellsons
important as they are to french credit avoid all naming of the
matter  i carry about me not a scrap of writing openly referring to
it  this is a secret service altogether  my credentials entries
and memoranda are all comprehended in the one line recalled to
life which may mean anything  but what is the matter  she doesnt
notice a word  miss manette

perfectly still and silent and not even fallen back in her chair
she sat under his hand utterly insensible with her eyes open and
fixed upon him and with that last expression looking as if it were
carved or branded into her forehead  so close was her hold upon his
arm that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her
therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving

a wildlooking woman whom even in his agitation mr lorry observed
to be all of a red colour and to have red hair and to be dressed in
some extraordinary tightfitting fashion and to have on her head a
most wonderful bonnet like a grenadier wooden measure and good
measure too or a great stilton cheese came running into the room in
advance of the inn servants and soon settled the question of his
detachment from the poor young lady by laying a brawny hand upon his
chest and sending him flying back against the nearest wall

i really think this must be a man was mr lorrys breathless
reflection simultaneously with his coming against the wall

why look at you all bawled this figure addressing the inn
servants  why dont you go and fetch things instead of standing
there staring at me  i am not so much to look at am i  why dont
you go and fetch things  ill let you know if you dont bring
smellingsalts cold water and vinegar quick i will

there was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives and she
softly laid the patient on a sofa and tended her with great skill
and gentleness  calling her my precious and my bird and spreading
her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care

and you in brown she said indignantly turning to mr lorry
couldnt you tell her what you had to tell her without frightening
her to death  look at her with her pretty pale face and her cold
hands  do you call that being a banker

mr lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
answer that he could only look on at a distance with much feebler
sympathy and humility while the strong woman having banished the
inn servants under the mysterious penalty of letting them know
something not mentioned if they stayed there staring recovered her
charge by a regular series of gradations and coaxed her to lay her
drooping head upon her shoulder

i hope she will do well now said mr lorry

no thanks to you in brown if she does  my darling pretty

i hope said mr lorry after another pause of feeble sympathy and
humility that you accompany miss manette to france

a likely thing too replied the strong woman  if it was ever
intended that i should go across salt water do you suppose
providence would have cast my lot in an island

this being another question hard to answer mr jarvis lorry withdrew
to consider it



v

the wineshop


a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken in the street
the accident had happened in getting it out of a cart the cask had
tumbled out with a run the hoops had burst and it lay on the stones
just outside the door of the wineshop shattered like a
walnutshell

all the people within reach had suspended their business or their
idleness to run to the spot and drink the wine  the rough
irregular stones of the street pointing every way and designed
one might have thought expressly to lame all living creatures that
approached them had dammed it into little pools these were surrounded
each by its own jostling group or crowd according to its size
some men kneeled down made scoops of their two hands joined and
sipped or tried to help women who bent over their shoulders to
sip before the wine had all run out between their fingers  others
men and women dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated
earthenware or even with handkerchiefs from womens heads which
were squeezed dry into infants mouths others made small mud
embankments to stem the wine as it ran others directed by
lookerson up at high windows darted here and there to cut off
little streams of wine that started away in new directions others
devoted themselves to the sodden and leedyed pieces of the cask
licking and even champing the moister winerotted fragments with
eager relish  there was no drainage to carry off the wine and not
only did it all get taken up but so much mud got taken up along with
it that there might have been a scavenger in the street if anybody
acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence

a shrill sound of laughter and of amused voicesvoices of men
women and childrenresounded in the street while this wine game
lasted  there was little roughness in the sport and much playfulness
there was a special companionship in it an observable inclination on
the part of every one to join some other one which led especially
among the luckier or lighterhearted to frolicsome embraces
drinking of healths shaking of hands and even joining of hands and
dancing a dozen together  when the wine was gone and the places
where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridironpattern by
fingers these demonstrations ceased as suddenly as they had broken
out  the man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was
cutting set it in motion again the women who had left on a doorstep
the little pot of hot ashes at which she had been trying to soften
the pain in her own starved fingers and toes or in those of her
child returned to it men with bare arms matted locks and cadaverous
faces who had emerged into the winter light from cellars moved
away to descend again and a gloom gathered on the scene that
appeared more natural to it than sunshine

the wine was red wine and had stained the ground of the narrow
street in the suburb of saint antoine in paris where it was
spilled  it had stained many hands too and many faces and many
naked feet and many wooden shoes  the hands of the man who sawed
the wood left red marks on the billets and the forehead of the
woman who nursed her baby was stained with the stain of the old rag
she wound about her head again  those who had been greedy with the
staves of the cask had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth
and one tall joker so besmirched his head more out of a long squalid
bag of a nightcap than in it scrawled upon a wall with his finger
dipped in muddy wineleesblood

the time was to come when that wine too would be spilled on the
streetstones and when the stain of it would be red upon many there

and now that the cloud settled on saint antoine which a momentary
gleam had driven from his sacred countenance the darkness of it was
heavycold dirt sickness ignorance and want were the lords in
waiting on the saintly presencenobles of great power all of them
but most especially the last  samples of a people that had
undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill and
certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young
shivered at every corner passed in and out at every doorway looked
from every window fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the
wind shook  the mill which had worked them down was the mill that
grinds young people old the children had ancient faces and grave
voices and upon them and upon the grown faces and ploughed into
every furrow of age and coming up afresh was the sigh hunger  it
was prevalent everywhere  hunger was pushed out of the tall houses
in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines hunger was
patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper hunger was
repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the
man sawed off hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys and
started up from the filthy street that had no offal among its refuse
of anything to eat  hunger was the inscription on the bakers
shelves written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad
bread at the sausageshop in every deaddog preparation that was
offered for sale  hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
chestnuts in the turned cylinder hunger was shred into atomics in
every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato fried with some
reluctant drops of oil

its abiding place was in all things fitted to it  a narrow winding
street full of offence and stench with other narrow winding streets
diverging all peopled by rags and nightcaps and all smelling of
rags and nightcaps and all visible things with a brooding look upon
them that looked ill  in the hunted air of the people there was yet
some wildbeast thought of the possibility of turning at bay  depressed
and slinking though they were eyes of fire were not wanting among
them nor compressed lips white with what they suppressed nor
foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallowsrope they mused
about enduring or inflicting  the trade signs and they were almost
as many as the shops were all grim illustrations of want  the
butcher and the porkman painted up only the leanest scrags of meat
the baker the coarsest of meagre loaves  the people rudely pictured
as drinking in the wineshops croaked over their scanty measures of
thin wine and beer and were gloweringly confidential together
nothing was represented in a flourishing condition save tools and
weapons but the cutlers knives and axes were sharp and bright the
smiths hammers were heavy and the gunmakers stock was murderous
the crippling stones of the pavement with their many little
reservoirs of mud and water had no footways but broke off abruptly
at the doors  the kennel to make amends ran down the middle of the
streetwhen it ran at all  which was only after heavy rains and
then it ran by many eccentric fits into the houses  across the
streets at wide intervals one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
pulley at night when the lamplighter had let these down and lighted
and hoisted them again a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
manner overhead as if they were at sea  indeed they were at sea
and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest

for the time was to come when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
should have watched the lamplighter in their idleness and hunger
so long as to conceive the idea of improving on his method and
hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys to flare upon the
darkness of their condition  but the time was not come yet and
every wind that blew over france shook the rags of the scarecrows
in vain for the birds fine of song and feather took no warning

the wineshop was a corner shop better than most others in its
appearance and degree and the master of the wineshop had stood
outside it in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches looking on at
the struggle for the lost wine  its not my affair said he
with a final shrug of the shoulders  the people from the market
did it  let them bring another

there his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his
joke he called to him across the way

say then my gaspard what do you do there

the fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance as is often
the way with his tribe  it missed its mark and completely failed
as is often the way with his tribe too

what now  are you a subject for the mad hospital said the
wineshop keeper crossing the road and obliterating the jest with
a handful of mud picked up for the purpose and smeared over it
why do you write in the public streets  is theretell me thouis
there no other place to write such words in

in his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand perhaps accidentally
perhaps not upon the jokers heart  the joker rapped it with his
own took a nimble spring upward and came down in a fantastic
dancing attitude with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot
into his hand and held out  a joker of an extremely not to say
wolfishly practical character he looked under those circumstances

put it on put it on said the other  call wine wine and finish
there  with that advice he wiped his soiled hand upon the jokers
dress such as it wasquite deliberately as having dirtied the hand
on his account and then recrossed the road and entered the wineshop

this wineshop keeper was a bullnecked martiallooking man of
thirty and he should have been of a hot temperament for although
it was a bitter day he wore no coat but carried one slung over his
shoulder  his shirtsleeves were rolled up too and his brown arms
were bare to the elbows  neither did he wear anything more on his
head than his own crisplycurling short dark hair  he was a dark man
altogether with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them
goodhumoured looking on the whole but implacablelooking too
evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose a man not
desirable to be met rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either
side for nothing would turn the man

madame defarge his wife sat in the shop behind the counter as he
came in  madame defarge was a stout woman of about his own age with
a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything a large hand
heavily ringed a steady face strong features and great composure
of manner  there was a character about madame defarge from which
one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against
herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided  madame
defarge being sensitive to cold was wrapped in fur and had a
quantity of bright shawl twined about her head though not to the
concealment of her large earrings  her knitting was before her but
she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick  thus
engaged with her right elbow supported by her left hand madame
defarge said nothing when her lord came in but coughed just one
grain of cough  this in combination with the lifting of her darkly
defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line suggested
to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the
customers for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped
over the way

the wineshop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady who were seated in
a corner  other company were there  two playing cards two playing
dominoes three standing by the counter lengthening out a short
supply of wine  as he passed behind the counter he took notice that
the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady this is our
man

what the devil do you do in that galley there said monsieur
defarge to himself i dont know you

but he feigned not to notice the two strangers and fell into
discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the
counter

how goes it jacques said one of these three to monsieur defarge
is all the spilt wine swallowed

every drop jacques answered monsieur defarge

when this interchange of christian name was effected madame defarge
picking her teeth with her toothpick coughed another grain of cough
and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line

it is not often said the second of the three addressing monsieur
defarge that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine
or of anything but black bread and death  is it not so jacques

it is so jacques monsieur defarge returned

at this second interchange of the christian name madame defarge
still using her toothpick with profound composure coughed another
grain of cough and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line

the last of the three now said his say as he put down his empty
drinking vessel and smacked his lips

ah  so much the worse  a bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
always have in their mouths and hard lives they live jacques
am i right jacques

you are right jacques was the response of monsieur defarge

this third interchange of the christian name was completed at the
moment when madame defarge put her toothpick by kept her eyebrows
up and slightly rustled in her seat

hold then  true muttered her husband  gentlemenmy wife

meaning of these creatures  they have but one and its midnight
murder and mischief

hush dear  pray pray be cautious cried lucie

yes yes yes ill be cautious said miss pross but i may say
among ourselves that i do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey
smotherings in the form of embracings all round going on in the
streets  now ladybird never you stir from that fire till i come
back  take care of the dear husband you have recovered and dont
move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now till you
see me again  may i ask a question doctor manette before i go

i think you may take that liberty the doctor answered smiling

for gracious sake dont talk about liberty we have quite enough of
that said miss pross

hush dear  again lucie remonstrated

well my sweet said miss pross nodding her head emphatically
the short and the long of it is that i am a subject of his most
gracious majesty king george the third miss pross curtseyed at the
name and as such my maxim is confound their politics frustrate
their knavish tricks on him our hopes we fix god save the king

mr cruncher in an access of loyalty growlingly repeated the words
after miss pross like somebody at church

i am glad you have so much of the englishman in you though i wish
you had never taken that cold in your voice said miss pross
approvingly  but the question doctor manette  is thereit was
the good creatures way to affect to make light of anything that was
a great anxiety with them all and to come at it in this chance
manneris there any prospect yet of our getting out of this place

i fear not yet  it would be dangerous for charles yet

heighhohum said miss pross cheerfully repressing a sigh as she
glanced at her darlings golden hair in the light of the fire
then we must have patience and wait  thats all  we must hold up
our heads and fight low as my brother solomon used to say
now mr cruncherdont you move ladybird

they went out leaving lucie and her husband her father and the
child by a bright fire  mr lorry was expected back presently from
the banking house  miss pross had lighted the lamp but had put it
aside in a corner that they might enjoy the firelight undisturbed
little lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through
his arm  and he in a tone not rising much above a whisper began to
tell her a story of a great and powerful fairy who had opened a
prisonwall and let out a captive who had once done the fairy a
service  all was subdued and quiet and lucie was more at ease than
she had been

what is that she cried all at once

my dear said her father stopping in his story and laying his
hand on hers command yourself  what a disordered state you are in
the least thingnothingstartles you  you your fathers daughter

i thought my father said lucie excusing herself with a pale face
and in a faltering voice that i heard strange feet upon the stairs

my love the staircase is as still as death

as he said the word a blow was struck upon the door

oh father father  what can this be  hide charles  save him

my child said the doctor rising and laying his hand upon her
shoulder i have saved him  what weakness is this my dear
let me go to the door

he took the lamp in his hand crossed the two intervening outer
rooms and opened it  a rude clattering of feet over the floor
and four rough men in red caps armed with sabres and pistols
entered the room

the citizen evremonde called darnay said the first

who seeks him answered darnay

i seek him  we seek him  i know you evremonde i saw you before
the tribunal today  you are again the prisoner of the republic

the four surrounded him where he stood with his wife and child
clinging to him

tell me how and why am i again a prisoner

it is enough that you return straight to the conciergerie and will
know tomorrow  you are summoned for tomorrow

doctor manette whom this visitation had so turned into stone that
he stood with the lamp in his hand as if be woe a statue made to
hold it moved after these words were spoken put the lamp down and
confronting the speaker and taking him not ungently by the loose
front of his red woollen shirt said

you know him you have said  do you know me

yes i know you citizen doctor

we all know you citizen doctor said the other three

he looked abstractedly from one to another and said in a lower
voice after a pause

will you answer his question to me then  how does this happen

citizen doctor said the first reluctantly he has been denounced
to the section of saint antoine  this citizen pointing out the
second who had entered is from saint antoine

the citizen here indicated nodded his head and added

he is accused by saint antoine

of what asked the doctor

citizen doctor said the first with his former reluctance ask no
more  if the republic demands sacrifices from you without doubt you
as a good patriot will be happy to make them  the republic goes
before all  the people is supreme  evremonde we are pressed

one word the doctor entreated  will you tell me who denounced him

it is against rule answered the first but you can ask him of
saint antoine here

the doctor turned his eyes upon that man  who moved uneasily on his
feet rubbed his beard a little and at length said

well  truly it is against rule  but he is denouncedand
gravelyby the citizen and citizeness defarge  and by one other

what other

do you ask citizen doctor

yes

then said he of saint antoine with a strange look you will be
answered tomorrow  now i am dumb

a hand at cards


happily unconscious of the new calamity at home miss pross threaded
her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge
of the pontneuf reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable
purchases she had to make  mr cruncher with the basket walked at
her side  they both looked to the right and to the left into most of
the shops they passed had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages
of people and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited
group of talkers  it was a raw evening and the misty river blurred
to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises
showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked
making guns for the army of the republic  woe to the man who played
tricks with that army or got undeserved promotion in it  better
for him that his beard had never grown for the national razor shaved
him close

having purchased a few small articles of grocery and a measure of
oil for the lamp miss pross bethought herself of the wine they
wanted  after peeping into several wineshops she stopped at the
sign of the good republican brutus of antiquity not far from the
national palace once and twice the tuileries where the aspect of
things rather took her fancy  it had a quieter look than any other
place of the same description they had passed and though red with
patriotic caps was not so red as the rest  sounding mr cruncher
and finding him of her opinion miss pross resorted to the good
republican brutus of antiquity attended by her cavalier

slightly observant of the smoky lights of the people pipe in mouth
playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes of the one bare
breasted barearmed sootbegrimed workman reading a journal aloud
and of the others listening to him of the weapons worn or laid
aside to be resumed of the two or three customers fallen forward
asleep who in the popular highshouldered shaggy black spencer
looked in that attitude like slumbering bears or dogs the two
outlandish customers approached the counter and showed what they wanted

as their wine was measuring out a man parted from another man in a
corner and rose to depart  in going he had to face miss pross
no sooner did he face her than miss pross uttered a scream and
clapped her hands

in a moment the whole company were on their feet  that somebody was
assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the
likeliest occurrence  everybody looked to see somebody fall but
only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other the man
with all the outward aspect of a frenchman and a thorough republican
the woman evidently english

what was said in this disappointing anticlimax by the disciples of
the good republican brutus of antiquity except that it was something
very voluble and loud would have been as so much hebrew or chaldean
to miss pross and her protector though they had been all ears  but
they had no ears for anything in their surprise  for it must be
recorded that not only was miss pross lost in amazement and
agitation but mr cruncherthough it seemed on his own separate
and individual accountwas in a state of the greatest wonder

what is the matter said the man who had caused miss pross to scream
speaking in a vexed abrupt voice though in a low tone and in
english

oh solomon dear solomon cried miss pross clapping her hands
again  after not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so
long a time do i find you here

dont call me solomon  do you want to be the death of me asked
the man in a furtive frightened way

brother brother cried miss pross bursting into tears  have i
ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question

then hold your meddlesome tongue said solomon and come out if
you want to speak to me  pay for your wine and come out
whos this man

miss pross shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means
affectionate brother said through her tears mr cruncher

let him come out too said solomon  does he think me a ghost

apparently mr cruncher did to judge from his looks  he said not a
word however and miss pross exploring the depths of her reticule
through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine  as she
did so solomon turned to the followers of the good republican brutus
of antiquity and offered a few words of explanation in the french
language which caused them all to relapse into their former places
and pursuits

now said solomon stopping at the dark street corner
what do you want

how dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love
away from cried miss pross to give me such a greeting and show
me no affection

there  confound it  there said solomon making a dab at miss
prosss lips with his own  now are you content

miss pross only shook her head and wept in silence

if you expect me to be surprised said her brother solomon i am
not surprised i knew you were here i know of most people who are
here  if you really dont want to endanger my existencewhich i half
believe you dogo your ways as soon as possible and let me go mine
i am busy  i am an official

my english brother solomon mourned miss pross casting up her
tearfraught eyes that had the makings in him of one of the best
and greatest of men in his native country an official among
foreigners and such foreigners  i would almost sooner have seen the
dear boy lying in his

i said so cried her brother interrupting  i knew it  you want
to be the death of me  i shall be rendered suspected by my own
sister  just as i am getting on

the gracious and merciful heavens forbid cried miss pross  far
rather would i never see you again dear solomon though i have ever
loved you truly and ever shall  say but one affectionate word to
me and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us and i
will detain you no longer

good miss pross  as if the estrangement between them had come of any
culpability of hers  as if mr lorry had not known it for a fact
years ago in the quiet corner in soho that this precious brother
had spent her money and left her

he was saying the affectionate word however with a far more
grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if
their relative merits and positions had been reversed which is
invariably the case all the world over when mr cruncher touching
him on the shoulder hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the
following singular question

i say  might i ask the favour  as to whether your name is john
solomon or solomon john

the official turned towards him with sudden distrust  he had not
previously uttered a word

come said mr cruncher  speak out you know  which by the
way was more than he could do himself  john solomon or solomon
john  she calls you solomon and she must know being your sister
and i know youre john you know  which of the two goes first
and regarding that name of pross likewise  that warnt your name
over the water

what do you mean

well i dont know all i mean for i cant call to mind what your
name was over the water

no

no  but ill swear it was a name of two syllables

indeed

yes  tother ones was one syllable  i know you  you was a spy
witness at the bailey  what in the name of the father of lies
own father to yourself was you called at that time

barsad said another voice striking in

thats the name for a thousand pound cried jerry

the speaker who struck in was sydney carton  he had his hands
behind him under the skirts of his ridingcoat and he stood at
mr crunchers elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the old
bailey itself

dont be alarmed my dear miss pross  i arrived at mr lorrys
to his surprise yesterday evening we agreed that i would not
present myself elsewhere until all was well or unless i could be
useful i present myself here to beg a little talk with your brother
i wish you had a better employed brother than mr barsad  i wish
for your sake mr barsad was not a sheep of the prisons

sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy under the gaolers
the spy who was pale turned paler and asked him how he dared

ill tell you said sydney  i lighted on you mr barsad coming
out of the prison of the conciergerie while i was contemplating the
walls an hour or more ago  you have a face to be remembered and i
remember faces well  made curious by seeing you in that connection
and having a reason to which you are no stranger for associating
you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate i walked
in your direction  i walked into the wineshop here close after you
and sat near you  i had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved
conversation and the rumour openly going about among your admirers
the nature of your calling  and gradually what i had done at random
seemed to shape itself into a purpose mr barsad

what purpose the spy asked

it would be troublesome and might be dangerous to explain in the
street  could you favour me in confidence with some minutes of
your companyat the office of tellsons bank for instance

under a threat

oh  did i say that

then why should i go there

really mr barsad i cant say if you cant

do you mean that you wont say sir the spy irresolutely asked

you apprehend me very clearly mr barsad  i wont

cartons negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of
his quickness and skill in such a business as he had in his secret
mind and with such a man as he had to do with  his practised eye
saw it and made the most of it

now i told you so said the spy casting a reproachful look at his
sister if any trouble comes of this its your doing

come come mr barsad exclaimed sydney  dont be
ungrateful  but for my great respect for your sister i might not
have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that i wish to make
for our mutual satisfaction  do you go with me to the bank

ill hear what you have got to say  yes ill go with you

i propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of
her own street  let me take your arm miss pross  this is not a
good city at this time for you to be out in unprotected and as
your escort knows mr barsad i will invite him to mr lorrys with us
are we ready  come then

miss pross recalled soon afterwards and to the end of her life
remembered that as she pressed her hands on sydneys arm and looked
up in his face imploring him to do no hurt to solomon there was a
braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes
which not only contradicted his light manner but changed and raised
the man  she was too much occupied then with fears for the brother
who so little deserved her affection and with sydneys friendly
reassurances adequately to heed what she observed

they left her at the corner of the street and carton led the way to
mr lorrys which was within a few minutes walk  john barsad or
solomon pross walked at his side

mr lorry had just finished his dinner and was sitting before a
cheery little log or two of fireperhaps looking into their blaze
for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from tellsons who
had looked into the red coals at the royal george at dover now a
good many years ago  he turned his head as they entered and showed
the surprise with which he saw a stranger

miss prosss brother sir said sydney  mr barsad

barsad repeated the old gentleman barsad  i have an association
with the nameand with the face

i told you you had a remarkable face mr barsad observed carton
coolly  pray sit down

as he took a chair himself he supplied the link that mr lorry
wanted by saying to him with a frown witness at that trial
mr lorry immediately remembered and regarded his new visitor with
an undisguised look of abhorrence

mr barsad has been recognised by miss pross as the affectionate
brother you have heard of said sydney and has acknowledged the
relationship  i pass to worse news  darnay has been arrested again

struck with consternation the old gentleman exclaimed what do you
tell me  i left him safe and free within these two hours and am
about to return to him

arrested for all that  when was it done mr barsad

just now if at all

mr barsad is the best authority possible sir said sydney and i
have it from mr barsads communication to a friend and brother sheep
over a bottle of wine that the arrest has taken place  he left the
messengers at the gate and saw them admitted by the porter
there is no earthly doubt that he is retaken

mr lorrys business eye read in the speakers face that it was loss
of time to dwell upon the point  confused but sensible that
something might depend on his presence of mind he commanded himself
and was silently attentive

now i trust said sydney to him that the name and influence of
doctor manette may stand him in as good stead tomorrowyou said he
would be before the tribunal again tomorrow mr barsad

yes i believe so

in as good stead tomorrow as today  but it may not be so
i own to you i am shaken mr lorry by doctor manettes not having
had the power to prevent this arrest

he may not have known of it beforehand said mr lorry

but that very circumstance would be alarming when we remember how
identified he is with his soninlaw

thats true mr lorry acknowledged with his troubled hand at his
chin and his troubled eyes on carton

in short said sydney this is a desperate time when desperate
games are played for desperate stakes  let the doctor play the
winning game i will play the losing one  no mans life here is
worth purchase  any one carried home by the people today may be
condemned tomorrow  now the stake i have resolved to play for in
case of the worst is a friend in the conciergerie  and the friend i
purpose to myself to win is mr barsad

you need have good cards sir said the spy

ill run them over  ill see what i holdmr lorry you know
what a brute i am i wish youd give me a little brandy

it was put before him and he drank off a glassfuldrank off another
glassfulpushed the bottle thoughtfully away

mr barsad he went on in the tone of one who really was looking
over a hand at cards  sheep of the prisons emissary of republican
committees now turnkey now prisoner always spy and secret
informer so much the more valuable here for being english that an
englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those
characters than a frenchman represents himself to his employers
under a false name  thats a very good card  mr barsad now in the
employ of the republican french government was formerly in the
employ of the aristocratic english government the enemy of france
and freedom  thats an excellent card  inference clear as day in
this region of suspicion that mr barsad still in the pay of the
aristocratic english government is the spy of pitt the treacherous
foe of the republic crouching in its bosom the english traitor and
agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find
thats a card not to be beaten  have you followed my hand mr barsad

not to understand your play returned the spy somewhat uneasily

i play my ace denunciation of mr barsad to the nearest section
committee  look over your hand mr barsad and see what you have
dont hurry

he drew the bottle near poured out another glassful of brandy
and drank it off  he saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking
himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him
seeing it he poured out and drank another glassful

look over your hand carefully mr barsad  take time

it was a poorer hand than he suspected  mr barsad saw losing cards
in it that sydney carton knew nothing of  thrown out of his
honourable employment in england through too much unsuccessful hard
swearing therenot because he was not wanted there our english
reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very
modern datehe knew that he had crossed the channel and accepted
service in france  first as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his
own countrymen there  gradually as a tempter and an eavesdropper
among the natives  he knew that under the overthrown government he
had been a spy upon saint antoine and defarges wineshop had
received from the watchful police such heads of information
concerning doctor manettes imprisonment release and history as
should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with
the defarges and tried them on madame defarge and had broken down
with them signally  he always remembered with fear and trembling
that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her and had
looked ominously at him as her fingers moved  he had since seen her
in the section of saint antoine over and over again produce her
knitted registers and denounce people whose lives the guillotine
then surely swallowed up  he knew as every one employed as he was
did that he was never safe that flight was impossible that he was
tied fast under the shadow of the axe and that in spite of his
utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning
terror a word might bring it down upon him  once denounced and on
such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind he
foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had
seen many proofs would produce against him that fatal register and
would quash his last chance of life  besides that all secret men are
men soon terrified here were surely cards enough of one black suit
to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over

you scarcely seem to like your hand said sydney with the greatest
composure  do you play

i think sir said the spy in the meanest manner as he turned to
mr lorry i may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence
to put it to this other gentleman so much your junior whether he
can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that
ace of which he has spoken  i admit that i am a spy and that it
is considered a discreditable stationthough it must be filled by
somebody but this gentleman is no spy and why should he so demean
himself as to make himself one

i play my ace mr barsad said carton taking the answer on himself
and looking at his watch without any scruple in a very few minutes

i should have hoped gentlemen both said the spy always striving
to hook mr lorry into the discussion that your respect for my
sister

i could not better testify my respect for your sister than by
finally relieving her of her brother said sydney carton

you think not sir

i have thoroughly made up my mind about it

the smooth manner of the spy curiously in dissonance with his
ostentatiously rough dress and probably with his usual demeanour
received such a check from the inscrutability of cartonwho was a
mystery to wiser and honester men than hethat it faltered here and
failed him  while he was at a loss carton said resuming his former
air of contemplating cards

and indeed now i think again i have a strong impression that i
have another good card here not yet enumerated  that friend and
fellowsheep who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons
who was he

french  you dont know him said the spy quickly

french eh repeated carton musing and not appearing to notice
him at all though he echoed his word  well he may be

is i assure you said the spy though its not important

though its not important repeated carton in the same mechanical
waythough its not importantno its not important  no  yet i
know the face

i think not  i am sure not  it cant be said the spy

itcantbe muttered sydney carton retrospectively and idling
his glass which fortunately was a small one again  cantbe
spoke good french  yet like a foreigner i thought

provincial said the spy

no  foreign cried carton striking his open hand on the table as
a light broke clearly on his mind  cly  disguised but the same man
we had that man before us at the old bailey

now there you are hasty sir said barsad with a smile that gave
his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side there you really
give me an advantage over you  cly who i will unreservedly admit
at this distance of time was a partner of mine has been dead
several years  i attended him in his last illness  he was buried in
london at the church of saint pancrasinthefields  his unpopularity
with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following
his remains but i helped to lay him in his coffin

here mr lorry became aware from where he sat of a most remarkable
goblin shadow on the wall  tracing it to its source he discovered
it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of
all the risen and stiff hair on mr crunchers head

let us be reasonable said the spy and let us be fair  to show
you how mistaken you are and what an unfounded assumption yours is
i will lay before you a certificate of clys burial which i happened
to have carried in my pocketbook with a hurried hand he produced
and opened it ever since  there it is  oh look at it look at it
you may take it in your hand its no forgery

here mr lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate and
mr cruncher rose and stepped forward  his hair could not have been
more violently on end if it had been that moment dressed by the cow
with the crumpled horn in the house that jack built

unseen by the spy mr cruncher stood at his side and touched him on
the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff

that there roger cly master said mr cruncher with a taciturn
and ironbound visage  so you put him in his coffin

i did

who took him out of it

barsad leaned back in his chair and stammered what do you mean

i mean said mr cruncher that he warnt never in it  no  not he
ill have my head took off if he was ever in it

the spy looked round at the two gentlemen they both looked in
unspeakable astonishment at jerry

i tell you said jerry that you buried pavingstones and earth in
that there coffin  dont go and tell me that you buried cly  it was
a take in  me and two more knows it

how do you know it

whats that to you  ecod growled mr cruncher its you i have got
a old grudge again is it with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen
id catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea

sydney carton who with mr lorry had been lost in amazement at
this turn of the business here requested mr cruncher to moderate
and explain himself

at another time sir he returned evasively the present time is
illconwenient for explainin  what i stand to is that he knows
well wot that there cly was never in that there coffin  let him say
he was in so much as a word of one syllable and ill either catch
hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea mr cruncher
dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer or ill out and announce him

humph  i see one thing said carton  i hold another card
mr barsad  impossible here in raging paris with suspicion filling
the air for you to outlive denunciation when you are in communication
with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself
who moreover has the mystery about him of having feigned death and
come to life again  a plot in the prisons of the foreigner against
the republic  a strong carda certain guillotine card  do you play

no returned the spy  i throw up  i confess that we were so
unpopular with the outrageous mob that i only got away from england
at the risk of being ducked to death and that cly was so ferreted up
and down that he never would have got away at all but for that sham
though how this man knows it was a sham is a wonder of wonders to me

never you trouble your head about this man retorted the
contentious mr cruncher youll have trouble enough with giving
your attention to that gentleman  and look here  once more
mr cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious
parade of his liberalityid catch hold of your throat and choke
you for half a guinea

the sheep of the prisons turned from him to sydney carton and said
with more decision it has come to a point  i go on duty soon and
cant overstay my time  you told me you had a proposal what is it
now it is of no use asking too much of me  ask me to do anything in
my office putting my head in great extra danger and i had better
trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent
in short i should make that choice  you talk of desperation
we are all desperate here  remember  i may denounce you if i think
proper and i can swear my way through stone walls and so can others
now what do you want with me

not very much  you are a turnkey at the conciergerie

i tell you once for all there is no such thing as an escape possible
said the spy firmly

why need you tell me what i have not asked  you are a turnkey at the
conciergerie

i am sometimes

you can be when you choose

i can pass in and out when i choose

sydney carton filled another glass with brandy poured it slowly out
upon the hearth and watched it as it dropped  it being all spent
he said rising

so far we have spoken before these two because it was as well that
the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me
come into the dark room here and let us have one final word alone



ix

the game made


while sydney carton and the sheep of the prisons were in the
adjoining dark room speaking so low that not a sound was heard
mr lorry looked at jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust  that
honest tradesmans manner of receiving the look did not inspire
confidence he changed the leg on which he rested as often as if he
had fifty of those limbs and were trying them all he examined his
fingernails with a very questionable closeness of attention and
whenever mr lorrys eye caught his he was taken with that peculiar
kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it which
is seldom if ever known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect
openness of character

jerry said mr lorry  come here

mr cruncher came forward sideways with one of his shoulders in
advance of him

what have you been besides a messenger

after some cogitation accompanied with an intent look at his patron
mr cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying agicultooral
character

my mind misgives me much said mr lorry angrily shaking a
forefinger at him that you have used the respectable and great
house of tellsons as a blind and that you have had an unlawful
occupation of an infamous description  if you have dont expect me
to befriend you when you get back to england  if you have dont
expect me to keep your secret  tellsons shall not be imposed upon

i hope sir pleaded the abashed mr cruncher that a gentleman
like yourself wot ive had the honour of odd jobbing till im grey at
it would think twice about harming of me even if it wos soi dont
say it is but even if it wos  and which it is to be took into
account that if it wos it wouldnt even then be all o one side
thered be two sides to it  there might be medical doctors at the
present hour a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman
dont pick up his fardensfardens no nor yet his half fardens
half fardens no nor yet his quartera banking away like smoke at
tellsons and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the
sly a going in and going out to their own carriagesah equally
like smoke if not more so  well that ud be imposing too on
tellsons  for you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander
and heres mrs cruncher or leastways wos in the old england times
and would be tomorrow if cause given a floppin again the business
to that degree as is ruinatingstark ruinating  whereas them medical
doctors wives dont flopcatch em at it  or if they flop their
toppings goes in favour of more patients and how can you rightly
have one without tother  then wot with undertakers and wot with
parish clerks and wot with sextons and wot with private watchmen
all awaricious and all in it a man wouldnt get much by it even
if it wos so  and wot little a man did get would never prosper with
him mr lorry  hed never have no good of it hed want all along
to be out of the line if he could see his way out being once in
even if it wos so

ugh cried mr lorry rather relenting nevertheless i am shocked
at the sight of you

now what i would humbly offer to you sir pursued mr cruncher
even if it wos so which i dont say it is

dont prevaricate said mr lorry

no i will not sir returned mr crunches as if nothing were
further from his thoughts or practicewhich i dont say it iswot
i would humbly offer to you sir would be this  upon that there
stool at that there bar sets that there boy of mine brought up and
growed up to be a man wot will errand you message you general
lightjob you till your heels is where your head is if such should
be your wishes  if it wos so which i still dont say it is for i
will not prewaricate to you sir let that there boy keep his
fathers place and take care of his mother dont blow upon that
boys fatherdo not do it sirand let that father go into the line
of the reglar diggin and make amends for what he would have
undugif it wos soby diggin of em in with a will and with
conwictions respectin the futur keepin of em safe  that
mr lorry said mr cruncher wiping his forehead with his arm as
an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his
discourse is wot i would respectfully offer to you sir  a man
dont see all this here a goin on dreadful round him in the way of
subjects without heads dear me plentiful enough fur to bring the
price down to porterage and hardly that without havin his serious
thoughts of things  and these here would be mine if it wos so
entreatin of you fur to bear in mind that wot i said just now i up
and said in the good cause when i might have kep it back

that at least is true said mr lorry  say no more now  it may be
that i shall yet stand your friend if you deserve it and repent in
actionnot in words  i want no more words

mr cruncher knuckled his forehead as sydney carton and the spy
returned from the dark room  adieu mr barsad said the former
our arrangement thus made you have nothing to fear from me

he sat down in a chair on the hearth over against mr lorry
when they were alone mr lorry asked him what he had done

not much  if it should go ill with the prisoner i have ensured
access to him once

mr lorrys countenance fell

it is all i could do said carton  to propose too much would be
to put this mans head under the axe and as he himself said
nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced  it was
obviously the weakness of the position  there is no help for it

but access to him said mr lorry if it should go ill before the
tribunal will not save him

i never said it would

mr lorrys eyes gradually sought the fire his sympathy with his
darling and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest gradually
weakened them he was an old man now overborne with anxiety of late
and his tears fell

you are a good man and a true friend said carton in an altered
voice  forgive me if i notice that you are affected  i could not
see my father weep and sit by careless  and i could not respect
your sorrow more if you were my father  you are free from that
misfortune however

though he said the last words with a slip into his usual manner
there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his
touch that mr lorry who had never seen the better side of him
was wholly unprepared for  he gave him his hand and carton gently
pressed it

to return to poor darnay said carton  dont tell her of this
interview or this arrangement  it would not enable her to go to see
him  she might think it was contrived in case of the worse to
convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence

mr lorry had not thought of that and he looked quickly at carton to
see if it were in his mind  it seemed to be he returned the look
and evidently understood it

she might think a thousand things carton said and any of them
would only add to her trouble  dont speak of me to her  as i said
to you when i first came i had better not see her  i can put my
hand out to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find
to do without that  you are going to her i hope  she must be very
desolate tonight

i am going now directly

i am glad of that  she has such a strong attachment to you and
reliance on you  how does she look

anxious and unhappy but very beautiful

ah

it was a long grieving sound like a sighalmost like a sob  it
attracted mr lorrys eyes to cartons face which was turned to the
fire  a light or a shade the old gentleman could not have said
which passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a
hillside on a wild bright day and he lifted his foot to put back
one of the little flaming logs which was tumbling forward  he wore
the white ridingcoat and topboots then in vogue and the light of
the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale with
his long brown hair all untrimmed hanging loose about him  his
indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of
remonstrance from mr lorry his boot was still upon the hot embers
of the flaming log when it had broken under the weight of his foot

i forgot it he said

mr lorrys eyes were again attracted to his face  taking note of
the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features and
having the expression of prisoners faces fresh in his mind he was
strongly reminded of that expression

and your duties here have drawn to an end sir said carton
turning to him

yes  as i was telling you last night when lucie came in so
unexpectedly i have at length done all that i can do here  i hoped
to have left them in perfect safety and then to have quitted paris
i have my leave to pass  i was ready to go

they were both silent

yours is a long life to look back upon sir said carton wistfully

i am in my seventyeighth year

you have been useful all your life steadily and constantly occupied
trusted respected and looked up to

i have been a man of business ever since i have been a man
indeed i may say that i was a man of business when a boy

see what a place you fill at seventyeight  how many people will
miss you when you leave it empty

a solitary old bachelor answered mr lorry shaking his
head  there is nobody to weep for me

how can you say that  wouldnt she weep for you  wouldnt her child

yes yes thank god  i didnt quite mean what i said

it is a thing to thank god for is it not

surely surely

if you could say with truth to your own solitary heart tonight
i have secured to myself the love and attachment the gratitude or
respect of no human creature i have won myself a tender place in no
regard i have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by
your seventyeight years would be seventyeight heavy curses would
they not

you say truly mr carton i think they would be

sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire and after a silence of a
few moments said

i should like to ask youdoes your childhood seem far off  do the
days when you sat at your mothers knee seem days of very long ago

responding to his softened manner mr lorry answered

twenty years back yes at this time of my life no  for as i draw
closer and closer to the end i travel in the circle nearer and
nearer to the beginning  it seems to be one of the kind smoothings
and preparings of the way  my heart is touched now by many
remembrances that had long fallen asleep of my pretty young mother
and i so old and by many associations of the days when what we
call the world was not so real with me and my faults were not
confirmed in me

i understand the feeling exclaimed carton with a bright flush
and you are the better for it

i hope so

carton terminated the conversation here by rising to help him on
with his outer coat but you said mr lorry reverting to the theme
you are young

yes said carton  i am not old but my young way was never the
way to age  enough of me

and of me i am sure said mr lorry  are you going out

ill walk with you to her gate  you know my vagabond and restless
habits  if i should prowl about the streets a long time dont be
uneasy i shall reappear in the morning  you go to the court tomorrow

yes unhappily

i shall be there but only as one of the crowd  my spy will find a
place for me  take my arm sir

mr lorry did so and they went downstairs and out in the streets
a few minutes brought them to mr lorrys destination  carton left
him there but lingered at a little distance and turned back to the
gate again when it was shut and touched it  he had heard of her
going to the prison every day  she came out here he said looking
about him turned this way must have trod on these stones often
let me follow in her steps

it was ten oclock at night when he stood before the prison of la
force where she had stood hundreds of times  a little woodsawyer
having closed his shop was smoking his pipe at his shopdoor

good night citizen said sydney carton pausing in going by
for the man eyed him inquisitively

good night citizen

how goes the republic

you mean the guillotine  not ill  sixtythree today  we shall
mount to a hundred soon  samson and his men complain sometimes of
being exhausted  ha ha ha  he is so droll that samson
such a barber

do you often go to see him

shave  always  every day  what a barber  you have seen him at work

never

go and see him when he has a good batch  figure this to yourself
citizen he shaved the sixtythree today in less than two pipes
less than two pipes  word of honour

as the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking to
explain how he timed the executioner carton was so sensible of a
rising desire to strike the life out of him that he turned away

but you are not english said the woodsawyer though you wear
english dress

yes said carton pausing again and answering over his shoulder

you speak like a frenchman

i am an old student here

aha a perfect frenchman  good night englishman

good night citizen

but go and see that droll dog the little man persisted calling
after him  and take a pipe with you

sydney had not gone far out of sight when he stopped in the middle
of the street under a glimmering lamp and wrote with his pencil on a
scrap of paper  then traversing with the decided step of one who
remembered the way well several dark and dirty streetsmuch dirtier
than usual for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in
those times of terrorhe stopped at a chemists shop which the
owner was closing with his own hands  a small dim crooked shop
kept in a tortuous uphill thoroughfare by a small dim crooked man

giving this citizen too good night as he confronted him at his
counter he laid the scrap of paper before him  whew the chemist
whistled softly as he read it  hi hi hi

sydney carton took no heed and the chemist said

for you citizen

for me

you will be careful to keep them separate citizen  you know the
consequences of mixing them

perfectly

certain small packets were made and given to him  he put them one
by one in the breast of his inner coat counted out the money for
them and deliberately left the shop  there is nothing more to do
said he glancing upward at the moon until tomorrow  i cant sleep

it was not a reckless manner the manner in which he said these words
aloud under the fastsailing clouds nor was it more expressive of
negligence than defiance  it was the settled manner of a tired man
who had wandered and struggled and got lost but who at length struck
into his road and saw its end

long ago when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a
youth of great promise he had followed his father to the grave
his mother had died years before  these solemn words which had
been read at his fathers grave arose in his mind as he went down
the dark streets among the heavy shadows with the moon and the
clouds sailing on high above him  i am the resurrection and the
life saith the lord  he that believeth in me though he were dead
yet shall he live  and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall
never die

in a city dominated by the axe alone at night with natural sorrow
rising in him for the sixtythree who had been that day put to death
and for tomorrows victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons
and still of tomorrows and tomorrows the chain of association
that brought the words home like a rusty old ships anchor from the
deep might have been easily found  he did not seek it but repeated
them and went on

with a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were
going to rest forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors
surrounding them in the towers of the churches where no prayers
were said for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length
of selfdestruction from years of priestly impostors plunderers and
profligates in the distant burialplaces reserved as they wrote
upon the gates for eternal sleep in the abounding gaols and in the
streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so
common and material that no sorrowful story of a haunting spirit
ever arose among the people out of all the working of the guillotine
with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city
settling down to its short nightly pause in fury sydney carton
crossed the seine again for the lighter streets

few coaches were abroad for riders in coaches were liable to be
suspected and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps and put on
heavy shoes and trudged  but the theatres were all well filled
and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed and went chatting
home  at one of the theatre doors there was a little girl with a
mother looking for a way across the street through the mud
he carried the child over and before the timid arm was loosed from
his neck asked her for a kiss

i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord  he that
believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live  and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die

now that the streets were quiet and the night wore on the words
were in the echoes of his feet and were in the air  perfectly calm
and steady he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked but
he heard them always

the night wore out and as he stood upon the bridge listening to the
water as it splashed the riverwalls of the island of paris where
the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the
light of the moon the day came coldly looking like a dead face out
of the sky  then the night with the moon and the stars turned pale
and died and for a little while it seemed as if creation were
delivered over to deaths dominion

but the glorious sun rising seemed to strike those words that
burden of the night straight and warm to his heart in its long
bright rays  and looking along them with reverently shaded eyes
a bridge of light appeared to span the air between him and the sun
while the river sparkled under it

the strong tide so swift so deep and certain was like a congenial
friend in the morning stillness  he walked by the stream far from
the houses and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the
bank  when he awoke and was afoot again he lingered there yet a
little longer watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless
until the stream absorbed it and carried it on to the sealike me

a tradingboat with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf
then glided into his view floated by him and died away  as its
silent track in the water disappeared the prayer that had broken up
out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor
blindnesses and errors ended in the words i am the resurrection
and the life

mr lorry was already out when he got back and it was easy to
surmise where the good old man was gone  sydney carton drank nothing
but a little coffee ate some bread and having washed and changed
to refresh himself went out to the place of trial

the court was all astir and abuzz when the black sheepwhom many
fell away from in dreadpressed him into an obscure corner among the
crowd  mr lorry was there and doctor manette was there  she was
there sitting beside her father

when her husband was brought in she turned a look upon him so
sustaining so encouraging so full of admiring love and pitying
tenderness yet so courageous for his sake that it called the
healthy blood into his face brightened his glance and animated his
heart  if there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her
look on sydney carton it would have been seen to be the same
influence exactly

before that unjust tribunal there was little or no order of
procedure ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing
there could have been no such revolution if all laws forms and
ceremonies had not first been so monstrously abused that the
suicidal vengeance of the revolution was to scatter them all to the
winds

every eye was turned to the jury  the same determined patriots and
good republicans as yesterday and the day before and tomorrow and
the day after  eager and prominent among them one man with a
craving face and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips
whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators  a life
thirsting canniballooking bloodyminded juryman the jacques three
of st antoine  the whole jury as a jury of dogs empannelled to try
the deer

every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor
no favourable leaning in that quarter today  a fell uncompromising
murderous businessmeaning there  every eye then sought some other
eye in the crowd and gleamed at it approvingly and heads nodded at
one another before bending forward with a strained attention

charles evremonde called darnay  released yesterday  reaccused and
retaken yesterday  indictment delivered to him last night  suspected
and denounced enemy of the republic aristocrat one of a family of
tyrants one of a race proscribed for that they had used their
abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people
charles evremonde called darnay in right of such proscription
absolutely dead in law

to this effect in as few or fewer words the public prosecutor

the president asked was the accused openly denounced or secretly

openly president

by whom

three voices  ernest defarge winevendor of st antoine

good

therese defarge his wife

good

alexandre manette physician

a great uproar took place in the court and in the midst of it
doctor manette was seen pale and trembling standing where he had
been seated

president i indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a
fraud  you know the accused to be the husband of my daughter  my
daughter and those dear to her are far dearer to me than my life
who and where is the false conspirator who says that i denounce the
husband of my child

citizen manette be tranquil  to fail in submission to the
authority of the tribunal would be to put yourself out of law
as to what is dearer to you than life nothing can be so dear to a
good citizen as the republic

loud acclamations hailed this rebuke  the president rang his bell
and with warmth resumed

if the republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
herself you would have no duty but to sacrifice her  listen to what
is to follow  in the meanwhile be silent

frantic acclamations were again raised  doctor manette sat down
with his eyes looking around and his lips trembling his daughter
drew closer to him  the craving man on the jury rubbed his hands
together and restored the usual hand to his mouth

defarge was produced when the court was quiet enough to admit of his
being heard and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment and
of his having been a mere boy in the doctors service and of the
release and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered
to him  this short examination followed for the court was quick
with its work

you did good service at the taking of the bastille citizen

i believe so

here an excited woman screeched from the crowd  you were one of the
best patriots there  why not say so  you were a cannonier that day
there and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress
when it fell  patriots i speak the truth

it was the vengeance who amidst the warm commendations of the
audience thus assisted the proceedings  the president rang his
bell but the vengeance warming with encouragement shrieked
i defy that bell wherein she was likewise much commended

inform the tribunal of what you did that day within the bastille
citizen

i knew said defarge looking down at his wife who stood at the
bottom of the steps on which he was raised looking steadily up at
him i knew that this prisoner of whom i speak had been confined
in a cell known as one hundred and five north tower  i knew it from
himself  he knew himself by no other name than one hundred and five
north tower when he made shoes under my care  as i serve my gun
that day i resolve when the place shall fall to examine that cell
it falls  i mount to the cell with a fellowcitizen who is one of
the jury directed by a gaoler  i examine it very closely  in a
hole in the chimney where a stone has been worked out and replaced
i find a written paper  this is that written paper  i have made it
my business to examine some specimens of the writing of doctor
manette  this is the writing of doctor manette  i confide this
paper in the writing of doctor manette to the hands of the president

let it be read

in a dead silence and stillnessthe prisoner under trial looking
lovingly at his wife his wife only looking from him to look with
solicitude at her father doctor manette keeping his eyes fixed on
the reader madame defarge never taking hers from the prisoner
defarge never taking his from his feasting wife and all the other
eyes there intent upon the doctor who saw none of themthe paper
was read as follows



x

the substance of the shadow


i alexandre manette unfortunate physician native of beauvais
and afterwards resident in paris write this melancholy paper in my
doleful cell in the bastille during the last month of the year
  i write it at stolen intervals under every difficulty
i design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney where i have
slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it  some
pitying hand may find it there when i and my sorrows are dust

these words are formed by the rusty iron point with which i write
with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney
mixed with blood in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity
hope has quite departed from my breast  i know from terrible
warnings i have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain
unimpaired but i solemnly declare that i am at this time in the
possession of my right mindthat my memory is exact and
circumstantialand that i write the truth as i shall answer for
these my last recorded words whether they be ever read by men or not
at the eternal judgmentseat

one cloudy moonlight night in the third week of december i think
the twentysecond of the month in the year  i was walking on a
retired part of the quay by the seine for the refreshment of the
frosty air at an hours distance from my place of residence in the
street of the school of medicine when a carriage came along behind
me driven very fast  as i stood aside to let that carriage pass
apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down a head was put out
at the window and a voice called to the driver to stop

the carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses
and the same voice called to me by my name  i answered  the carriage
was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open
the door and alight before i came up with it

i observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks and appeared to
conceal themselves  as they stood side by side near the carriage
door i also observed that they both looked of about my own age or
rather younger and that they were greatly alike in stature manner
voice and as far as i could see face too

you are doctor manette said one

i am

doctor manette formerly of beauvais said the other the young
physician originally an expert surgeon who within the last year or
two has made a rising reputation in paris

gentlemen i returned i am that doctor manette of whom you speak
so graciously

we have been to your residence said the first and not being so
fortunate as to find you there and being informed that you were
probably walking in this direction we followed in the hope of
overtaking you  will you please to enter the carriage

the manner of both was imperious and they both moved as these
words were spoken so as to place me between themselves and the
carriage door  they were armed  i was not

gentlemen said i pardon me but i usually inquire who does me
the honour to seek my assistance and what is the nature of the case
to which i am summoned

the reply to this was made by him who had spoken second
doctor your clients are people of condition  as to the nature of
the case our confidence in your skill assures us that you will
ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it  enough
will you please to enter the carriage

i could do nothing but comply and i entered it in silence  they
both entered after methe last springing in after putting up the
steps  the carriage turned about and drove on at its former speed

i repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred  i have no doubt
that it is word for word the same  i describe everything exactly
as it took place constraining my mind not to wander from the task
where i make the broken marks that follow here i leave off for the
time and put my paper in its hidingplace



the carriage left the streets behind passed the north barrier and
emerged upon the country road  at twothirds of a league from the
barrieri did not estimate the distance at that time but afterwards
when i traversed itit struck out of the main avenue and presently
stopped at a solitary house we all three alighted and walked by a
damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had
overflowed to the door of the house  it was not opened immediately
in answer to the ringing of the bell and one of my two conductors
struck the man who opened it with his heavy riding glove across the
face

there was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention
for i had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs
but the other of the two being angry likewise struck the man in
like manner with his arm the look and bearing of the brothers were
then so exactly alike that i then first perceived them to be twin
brothers

from the time of our alighting at the outer gate which we found
locked and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us and had
relocked i had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber  i was
conducted to this chamber straight the cries growing louder as we
ascended the stairs and i found a patient in a high fever of the brain
lying on a bed

the patient was a woman of great beauty and young assuredly not
much past twenty  her hair was torn and ragged and her arms were
bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs  i noticed that
these bonds were all portions of a gentlemans dress  on one of
them which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony i saw the
armorial bearings of a noble and the letter e

i saw this within the first minute of my contemplation of the
patient for in her restless strivings she had turned over on her
face on the edge of the bed had drawn the end of the scarf into her
mouth and was in danger of suffocation  my first act was to put out
my hand to relieve her breathing and in moving the scarf aside the
embroidery in the corner caught my sight

i turned her gently over placed my hands upon her breast to calm
her and keep her down and looked into her face  her eyes were
dilated and wild and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks and
repeated the words my husband my father and my brother and
then counted up to twelve and said hush  for an instant and no
more she would pause to listen and then the piercing shrieks would
begin again and she would repeat the cry my husband my father
and my brother and would count up to twelve and say hush  there
was no variation in the order or the manner  there was no cessation
but the regular moments pause in the utterance of these sounds

how long i asked has this lasted

to distinguish the brothers i will call them the elder and the
younger by the elder i mean him who exercised the most authority
it was the elder who replied since about this hour last night

she has a husband a father and a brother

a brother

i do not address her brother

he answered with great contempt no

she has some recent association with the number twelve

the younger brother impatiently rejoined with twelve oclock

see gentlemen said i still keeping my hands upon her breast
how useless i am as you have brought me  if i had known what i was
coming to see i could have come provided  as it is time must be
lost  there are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place

the elder brother looked to the younger who said haughtily there
is a case of medicines here and brought it from a closet and put
it on the table



i opened some of the bottles smelt them and put the stoppers to my
lips  if i had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that
were poisons in themselves i would not have administered any of those

do you doubt them asked the younger brother

you see monsieur i am going to use them i replied and said no
more

i made the patient swallow with great difficulty and after many
efforts the dose that i desired to give  as i intended to repeat it
after a while and as it was necessary to watch its influence i then
sat down by the side of the bed  there was a timid and suppressed
woman in attendance wife of the man downstairs who had retreated
into a corner  the house was damp and decayed indifferently
furnishedevidently recently occupied and temporarily used
some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows to
deaden the sound of the shrieks  they continued to be uttered in
their regular succession with the cry my husband my father and
my brother  the counting up to twelve and hush the frenzy was
so violent that i had not unfastened the bandages restraining the
arms but i had looked to them to see that they were not painful
the only spark of encouragement in the case was that my hand upon
the sufferers breast had this much soothing influence that for
minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure  it had no effect upon
the cries no pendulum could be more regular

for the reason that my hand had this effect i assume i had sat by
the side of the bed for half an hour with the two brothers looking
on before the elder said

there is another patient

i was startled and asked is it a pressing case

you had better see he carelessly answered and took up a light



the other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase
which was a species of loft over a stable  there was a low plastered
ceiling to a part of it the rest was open to the ridge of the tiled
roof and there were beams across  hay and straw were stored in that
portion of the place fagots for firing and a heap of apples in sand
i had to pass through that part to get at the other  my memory is
circumstantial and unshaken  i try it with these details and i see
them all in this my cell in the bastille near the close of the
tenth year of my captivity as i saw them all that night

on some hay on the ground with a cushion thrown under his head lay
a handsome peasant boya boy of not more than seventeen at the most
he lay on his back with his teeth set his right hand clenched on
his breast and his glaring eyes looking straight upward  i could
not see where his wound was as i kneeled on one knee over him
but i could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point

i am a doctor my poor fellow said i  let me examine it

i do not want it examined he answered let it be

it was under his hand and i soothed him to let me move his hand
away  the wound was a swordthrust received from twenty to twenty
four hours before but no skill could have saved him if it had been
looked to without delay  he was then dying fast  as i turned my
eyes to the elder brother i saw him looking down at this handsome
boy whose life was ebbing out as if he were a wounded bird or hare
or rabbit not at all as if he were a fellowcreature

how has this been done monsieur said i

a crazed young common dog  a serf  forced my brother to draw upon him
and has fallen by my brothers swordlike a gentleman

there was no touch of pity sorrow or kindred humanity in this
answer  the speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient
to have that different order of creature dying there and that it
would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of
his vermin kind  he was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling
about the boy or about his fate

the boys eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken and they
now slowly moved to me

doctor they are very proud these nobles but we common dogs are
proud too sometimes  they plunder us outrage us beat us kill us
but we have a little pride left sometimes  shehave you seen her
doctor

the shrieks and the cries were audible there though subdued by the
distance  he referred to them as if she were lying in our presence

i said i have seen her

she is my sister doctor  they have had their shameful rights
these nobles in the modesty and virtue of our sisters many years
but we have had good girls among us  i know it and have heard my
father say so  she was a good girl  she was betrothed to a good
young man too  a tenant of his  we were all tenants of histhat mans
who stands there  the other is his brother the worst of a bad race

it was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily
force to speak but his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis

we were so robbed by that man who stands there as all we common
dogs are by those superior beingstaxed by him without mercy obliged
to work for him without pay obliged to grind our corn at his mill
obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops and
forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own
pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a
bit of meat we ate it in fear with the door barred and the shutters
closed that his people should not see it and take it from usi say
we were so robbed and hunted and were made so poor that our father
told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world and
that what we should most pray for was that our women might be barren
and our miserable race die out

i had never before seen the sense of being oppressed bursting forth
like a fire  i had supposed that it must be latent in the people
somewhere but i had never seen it break out until i saw it in the
dying boy

nevertheless doctor my sister married  he was ailing at that
time poor fellow and she married her lover that she might tend and
comfort him in our cottageour doghut as that man would call it
she had not been married many weeks when that mans brother saw her
and admired her and asked that man to lend her to himfor what are
husbands among us  he was willing enough but my sister was good and
virtuous and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine
what did the two then to persuade her husband to use his influence
with her to make her willing

the boys eyes which had been fixed on mine slowly turned to the
lookeron and i saw in the two faces that all he said was true
the two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another i can see
even in this bastille the gentlemans all negligent indifference
the peasants all troddendown sentiment and passionate revenge

you know doctor that it is among the rights of these nobles to
harness us common dogs to carts and drive us  they so harnessed him
and drove him  you know that it is among their rights to keep us in
their grounds all night quieting the frogs in order that their
noble sleep may not be disturbed  they kept him out in the unwholesome
mists at night and ordered him back into his harness in the day
but he was not persuaded  no  taken out of harness one day at noon
to feedif he could find foodhe sobbed twelve times once for
every stroke of the bell and died on her bosom

nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination
to tell all his wrong  he forced back the gathering shadows of death
as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched and to cover
his wound

then with that mans permission and even with his aid his brother
took her away in spite of what i know she must have told his
brotherand what that is will not be long unknown to you doctor
if it is nowhis brother took her awayfor his pleasure and
diversion for a little while  i saw her pass me on the road
when i took the tidings home our fathers heart burst he never
spoke one of the words that filled it  i took my young sister for
i have another to a place beyond the reach of this man and where
at least she will never be his vassal  then i tracked the
brother here and last night climbed ina common dog but sword in
handwhere is the loft window  it was somewhere here

the room was darkening to his sight the world was narrowing around
him  i glanced about me and saw that the hay and straw were
trampled over the floor as if there had been a struggle

she heard me and ran in  i told her not to come near us till he
was dead  he came in and first tossed me some pieces of money then
struck at me with a whip  but i though a common dog so struck at
him as to make him draw  let him break into as many pieces as he
will the sword that he stained with my common blood he drew to
defend himselfthrust at me with all his skill for his life

my glance had fallen but a few moments before on the fragments of
a broken sword lying among the hay  that weapon was a gentlemans
in another place lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldiers

now lift me up doctor lift me up  where is he

he is not here i said supporting the boy and thinking that he
referred to the brother

he  proud as these nobles are he is afraid to see me  where is
the man who was here  turn my face to him

i did so raising the boys head against my knee  but invested for
the moment with extraordinary power he raised himself completely
obliging me to rise too or i could not have still supported him

marquis said the boy turned to him with his eyes opened wide
and his right hand raised in the days when all these things are to
be answered for i summon you and yours to the last of your bad race
to answer for them  i mark this cross of blood upon you as a sign
that i do it  in the days when all these things are to be answered
for i summon your brother the worst of the bad race to answer for
them separately  i mark this cross of blood upon him as a sign that
i do it

twice he put his hand to the wound in his breast and with his
forefinger drew a cross in the air  he stood for an instant with the
finger yet raised and as it dropped he dropped with it and i laid
him down dead



when i returned to the bedside of the young woman i found her
raving in precisely the same order of continuity  i knew that this
might last for many hours and that it would probably end in the
silence of the grave

i repeated the medicines i had given her and i sat at the side of
the bed until the night was far advanced  she never abated the
piercing quality of her shrieks never stumbled in the distinctness
or the order of her words  they were always my husband my father
and my brother  one two three four five six seven eight nine
ten eleven twelve  hush

this lasted twentysix hours from the time when i first saw her  i
had come and gone twice and was again sitting by her when she began
to falter  i did what little could be done to assist that opportunity
and byandbye she sank into a lethargy and lay like the dead

it was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last after a long and
fearful storm  i released her arms and called the woman to assist
me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn  it was then that
i knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations
of being a mother have arisen and it was then that i lost the little
hope i had had of her

is she dead asked the marquis whom i will still describe as the
elder brother coming booted into the room from his horse

not dead said i but like to die

what strength there is in these common bodies he said looking
down at her with some curiosity

there is prodigious strength i answered him in sorrow and despair

he first laughed at my words and then frowned at them  he moved a
chair with his foot near to mine ordered the woman away and said in
a subdued voice

doctor finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds
i recommended that your aid should be invited  your reputation is
high and as a young man with your fortune to make you are probably
mindful of your interest  the things that you see here are things
to be seen and not spoken of

i listened to the patients breathing and avoided answering

do you honour me with your attention doctor

monsieur said i in my profession the communications of
patients are always received in confidence  i was guarded in my
answer for i was troubled in my mind with what i had heard and seen

her breathing was so difficult to trace that i carefully tried the
pulse and the heart  there was life and no more  looking round as
i resumed my seat i found both the brothers intent upon me



i write with so much difficulty the cold is so severe i am so
fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and
total darkness that i must abridge this narrative  there is no
confusion or failure in my memory it can recall and could detail
every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers

she lingered for a week  towards the last i could understand some
few syllables that she said to me by placing my ear close to her lips
she asked me where she was and i told her who i was and i told her
it was in vain that i asked her for her family name  she faintly
shook her head upon the pillow and kept her secret as the boy had done

i had no opportunity of asking her any question until i had told
the brothers she was sinking fast and could not live another day
until then though no one was ever presented to her consciousness
save the woman and myself one or other of them had always jealously
sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when i was there
but when it came to that they seemed careless what communication i
might hold with her as ifthe thought passed through my mindi
were dying too

i always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
brothers as i call him having crossed swords with a peasant and
that peasant a boy  the only consideration that appeared to affect
the mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly
degrading to the family and was ridiculous  as often as i caught
the younger brothers eyes their expression reminded me that he
disliked me deeply for knowing what i knew from the boy  he was
smoother and more polite to me than the elder but i saw this
i also saw that i was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder too

my patient died two hours before midnightat a time by my watch
answering almost to the minute when i had first seen her  i was
alone with her when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one
side and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended

the brothers were waiting in a room downstairs impatient to ride
away  i had heard them alone at the bedside striking their boots
with their ridingwhips and loitering up and down

at last she is dead said the elder when i went in

she is dead said i

i congratulate you my brother were his words as he turned round

he had before offered me money which i had postponed taking  he
now gave me a rouleau of gold  i took it from his hand but laid it
on the table  i had considered the question and had resolved to
accept nothing

pray excuse me said i under the circumstances no

they exchanged looks but bent their heads to me as i bent mine to
them and we parted without another word on either side



i am weary weary wearyworn down by misery  i cannot read what i
have written with this gaunt hand

early in the morning the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
little box with my name on the outside  from the first i had
anxiously considered what i ought to do  i decided that day to
write privately to the minister stating the nature of the two cases
to which i had been summoned and the place to which i had gone  in
effect stating all the circumstances  i knew what court influence
was and what the immunities of the nobles were and i expected that
the matter would never be heard of but i wished to relieve my own
mind  i had kept the matter a profound secret even from my wife
and this too i resolved to state in my letter  i had no apprehension
whatever of my real danger but i was conscious that there might be
danger for others if others were compromised by possessing the
knowledge that i possessed

i was much engaged that day and could not complete my letter that
night  i rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it
it was the last day of the year  the letter was lying before me just
completed when i was told that a lady waited who wished to see me



i am growing more and more unequal to the task i have set myself
it is so cold so dark my senses are so benumbed and the gloom upon
me is so dreadful

the lady was young engaging and handsome but not marked for long
life  she was in great agitation  she presented herself to me as
the wife of the marquis st evremonde  i connected the title by
which the boy had addressed the elder brother with the initial
letter embroidered on the scarf and had no difficulty in arriving at
the conclusion that i had seen that nobleman very lately

my memory is still accurate but i cannot write the words of our
conversation  i suspect that i am watched more closely than i was
and i know not at what times i may be watched  she had in part
suspected and in part discovered the main facts of the cruel story
of her husbands share in it and my being resorted to  she did not
know that the girl was dead  her hope had been she said in great
distress to show her in secret a womans sympathy  her hope had
been to avert the wrath of heaven from a house that had long been
hateful to the suffering many

she had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living
and her greatest desire was to help that sister  i could tell her
nothing but that there was such a sister beyond that i knew nothing
her inducement to come to me relying on my confidence had been the
hope that i could tell her the name and place of abode  whereas
to this wretched hour i am ignorant of both



these scraps of paper fail me  one was taken from me with a
warning yesterday  i must finish my record today

she was a good compassionate lady and not happy in her marriage
how could she be  the brother distrusted and disliked her and his
influence was all opposed to her she stood in dread of him and in
dread of her husband too  when i handed her down to the door there
was a child a pretty boy from two to three years old in her carriage

for his sake doctor she said pointing to him in tears i would
do all i can to make what poor amends i can  he will never prosper
in his inheritance otherwise  i have a presentiment that if no other
innocent atonement is made for this it will one day be required of
him  what i have left to call my ownit is little beyond the worth
of a few jewelsi will make it the first charge of his life to
bestow with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother on this
injured family if the sister can be discovered

she kissed the boy and said caressing him it is for thine own
dear sake  thou wilt be faithful little charles the child
answered her bravely yes i kissed her hand and she took him in
her arms and went away caressing him  i never saw her more

as she had mentioned her husbands name in the faith that i knew it
i added no mention of it to my letter  i sealed my letter and not
trusting it out of my own hands delivered it myself that day

that night the last night of the year towards nine oclock a man
in a black dress rang at my gate demanded to see me and softly
followed my servant ernest defarge a youth upstairs  when my
servant came into the room where i sat with my wifeo my wife
beloved of my heart  my fair young english wifewe saw the man
who was supposed to be at the gate standing silent behind him

an urgent case in the rue st honore he said  it would not detain
me he had a coach in waiting

it brought me here it brought me to my grave  when i was clear of
the house a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from
behind and my arms were pinioned  the two brothers crossed the road
from a dark corner and identified me with a single gesture  the
marquis took from his pocket the letter i had written showed it me
burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held and extinguished
the ashes with his foot  not a word was spoken  i was brought here
i was brought to my living grave

if it had pleased god to put it in the hard heart of either of the
brothers in all these frightful years to grant me any tidings of my
dearest wifeso much as to let me know by a word whether alive or
deadi might have thought that he had not quite abandoned them
but now i believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them
and that they have no part in his mercies  and them and their
descendants to the last of their race i alexandre manette unhappy
prisoner do this last night of the year  in my unbearable agony
denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for
i denounce them to heaven and to earth

a terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done  a
sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but
blood  the narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the
time and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped
before it

little need in presence of that tribunal and that auditory to show
how the defarges had not made the paper public with the other
captured bastille memorials borne in procession and had kept it
biding their time  little need to show that this detested family
name had long been anathematised by saint antoine and was wrought
into the fatal register  the man never trod ground whose virtues and
services would have sustained him in that place that day against
such denunciation

and all the worse for the doomed man that the denouncer was a
wellknown citizen his own attached friend the father of his wife
one of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was for imitations
of the questionable public virtues of antiquity and for sacrifices
and selfimmolations on the peoples altar  therefore when the
president said else had his own head quivered on his shoulders
that the good physician of the republic would deserve better still of
the republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of aristocrats and
would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a
widow and her child an orphan there was wild excitement patriotic
fervour not a touch of human sympathy

much influence around him has that doctor murmured madame defarge
smiling to the vengeance  save him now my doctor save him

at every jurymans vote there was a roar  another and another
roar and roar

unanimously voted  at heart and by descent an aristocrat an enemy
of the republic a notorious oppressor of the people  back to the
conciergerie and death within fourandtwenty hours

dusk


the wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die fell under
the sentence as if she had been mortally stricken  but she uttered
no sound and so strong was the voice within her representing that
it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not
augment it that it quickly raised her even from that shock

the judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of
doors the tribunal adjourned  the quick noise and movement of the
courts emptying itself by many passages had not ceased when lucie
stood stretching out her arms towards her husband with nothing in
her face but love and consolation

if i might touch him  if i might embrace him once  o good citizens
if you would have so much compassion for us

there was but a gaoler left along with two of the four men who had
taken him last night and barsad  the people had all poured out to
the show in the streets  barsad proposed to the rest let her
embrace him then it is but a moment  it was silently acquiesced in
and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place
where he by leaning over the dock could fold her in his arms

farewell dear darling of my soul  my parting blessing on my love
we shall meet again where the weary are at rest

they were her husbands words as he held her to his bosom

i can bear it dear charles  i am supported from above  dont
suffer for me  a parting blessing for our child

i send it to her by you  i kiss her by you  i say farewell to her
by you

my husband  no  a moment  he was tearing himself apart from her
we shall not be separated long  i feel that this will break my heart
byandbye but i will do my duty while i can and when i leave her
god will raise up friends for her as he did for me

her father had followed her and would have fallen on his knees to
both of them but that darnay put out a hand and seized him crying

no no  what have you done what have you done that you should
kneel to us  we know now what a struggle you made of old  we know
now what you underwent when you suspected my descent and when you
knew it  we know now the natural antipathy you strove against and
conquered for her dear sake  we thank you with all our hearts and
all our love and duty  heaven be with you

her fathers only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair
and wring them with a shriek of anguish

it could not be otherwise said the prisoner  all things have
worked together as they have fallen out  it was the alwaysvain
endeavour to discharge my poor mothers trust that first brought my
fatal presence near you  good could never come of such evil
a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning  be comforted
and forgive me  heaven bless you

as he was drawn away his wife released him and stood looking after
him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer
and with a radiant look upon her face in which there was even a
comforting smile  as he went out at the prisoners door she turned
laid her head lovingly on her fathers breast tried to speak to him
and fell at his feet

then issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved
sydney carton came and took her up  only her father and mr lorry
were with her  his arm trembled as it raised her and supported her head
yet there was an air about him that was not all of pitythat had a flush
of pride in it

shall i take her to a coach  i shall never feel her weight

he carried her lightly to the door and laid her tenderly down in a
coach  her father and their old friend got into it and he took his
seat beside the driver

when they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not
many hours before to picture to himself on which of the rough stones
of the street her feet had trodden he lifted her again and carried
her up the staircase to their rooms  there he laid her down on a
couch where her child and miss pross wept over her

dont recall her to herself he said softly to the latter she is
better so  dont revive her to consciousness while she only faints

oh carton carton dear carton cried little lucie springing up
and throwing her arms passionately round him in a burst of grief
now that you have come i think you will do something to help mamma
something to save papa  o look at her dear carton  can you of all
the people who love her bear to see her so

he bent over the child and laid her blooming cheek against his face
he put her gently from him and looked at her unconscious mother

before i go he said and pausedi may kiss her

it was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her
face with his lips he murmured some words  the child who was
nearest to him told them afterwards and told her grandchildren when
she was a handsome old lady that she heard him say a life you love

when he had gone out into the next room he turned suddenly on
mr lorry and her father who were following and said to the latter

you had great influence but yesterday doctor manette let it at
least be tried  these judges and all the men in power are very
friendly to you and very recognisant of your services are they not

nothing connected with charles was concealed from me  i had the
strongest assurances that i should save him and i did  he returned
the answer in great trouble and very slowly

try them again  the hours between this and tomorrow afternoon are
few and short but try

i intend to try  i will not rest a moment

thats well  i have known such energy as yours do great things
before nowthough never he added with a smile and a sigh together
such great things as this  but try  of little worth as life is when
we misuse it it is worth that effort  it would cost nothing to lay
down if it were not

i will go said doctor manette to the prosecutor and the president
straight and i will go to others whom it is better not to name
i will write too andbut stay  there is a celebration in the streets
and no one will be accessible until dark

thats true  well  it is a forlorn hope at the best and not much
the forlorner for being delayed till dark  i should like to know how
you speed though mind  i expect nothing  when are you likely to
have seen these dread powers doctor manette

immediately after dark i should hope  within an hour or two from this

it will be dark soon after four  let us stretch the hour or two
if i go to mr lorrys at nine shall i hear what you have done
either from our friend or from yourself

yes

may you prosper

mr lorry followed sydney to the outer door and touching him on the
shoulder as he was going away caused him to turn

i have no hope said mr lorry in a low and sorrowful whisper

nor have i

if any one of these men or all of these men were disposed to spare
himwhich is a large supposition for what is his life or any mans
to themi doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in
the court

and so do i  i heard the fall of the axe in that sound

mr lorry leaned his arm upon the doorpost and bowed his face upon it

dont despond said carton very gently dont grieve
i encouraged doctor manette in this idea because i felt that it
might one day be consolatory to her  otherwise she might think his
life was want only thrown away or wasted and that might trouble her

yes yes yes returned mr lorry drying his eyes you are
right  but he will perish there is no real hope

yes  he will perish  there is no real hope echoed carton

and walked with a settled step downstairs

darkness


sydney carton paused in the street not quite decided where to go
at tellsons bankinghouse at nine he said with a musing face
shall i do well in the mean time to show myself  i think so
it is best that these people should know there is such a man as i
here it is a sound precaution and may be a necessary preparation
but care care care  let me think it out

checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object he took
a turn or two in the already darkening street and traced the thought
in his mind to its possible consequences  his first impression was
confirmed  it is best he said finally resolved that these
people should know there is such a man as i here  and he turned his
face towards saint antoine

defarge had described himself that day as the keeper of a wineshop
in the saint antoine suburb  it was not difficult for one who knew
the city well to find his house without asking any question  having
ascertained its situation carton came out of those closer streets
again and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep
after dinner  for the first time in many years he had no strong drink
since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine
and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on mr lorrys
hearth like a man who had done with it

it was as late as seven oclock when he awoke refreshed and went out
into the streets again  as he passed along towards saint antoine he
stopped at a shopwindow where there was a mirror and slightly
altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat and his coat
collar and his wild hair  this done he went on direct to defarges
and went in

there happened to be no customer in the shop but jacques three
of the restless fingers and the croaking voice  this man whom he
had seen upon the jury stood drinking at the little counter in
conversation with the defarges man and wife  the vengeance assisted
in the conversation like a regular member of the establishment

as carton walked in took his seat and asked in very indifferent
french for a small measure of wine madame defarge cast a careless
glance at him and then a keener and then a keener and then
advanced to him herself and asked him what it was he had ordered

he repeated what he had already said

english asked madame defarge inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows

after looking at her as if the sound of even a single french word
were slow to express itself to him he answered in his former strong
foreign accent  yes madame yes  i am english

madame defarge returned to her counter to get the wine and as he
took up a jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out
its meaning he heard her say i swear to you like evremonde

defarge brought him the wine and gave him good evening

how

good evening

oh  good evening citizen filling his glass  ah and good wine
i drink to the republic

defarge went back to the counter and said certainly a little
like  madame sternly retorted i tell you a good deal like
jacques three pacifically remarked he is so much in your mind
see you madame  the amiable vengeance added with a laugh yes
my faith  and you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing
him once more tomorrow

carton followed the lines and words of his paper with a slow
forefinger and with a studious and absorbed face  they were all
leaning their arms on the counter close together speaking low
after a silence of a few moments during which they all looked
towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the jacobin
editor they resumed their conversation

it is true what madame says observed jacques three  why stop
there is great force in that  why stop

well well reasoned defarge but one must stop somewhere
after all the question is still where

at extermination said madame

magnificent croaked jacques three  the vengeance also highly
approved

extermination is good doctrine my wife said defarge rather
troubled in general i say nothing against it  but this doctor has
suffered much you have seen him today you have observed his face
when the paper was read

i have observed his face repeated madame contemptuously and
angrily  yes  i have observed his face  i have observed his face
to be not the face of a true friend of the republic  let him take
care of his face

and you have observed my wife said defarge in a deprecatory
manner the anguish of his daughter which must be a dreadful
anguish to him

i have observed his daughter repeated madame yes i have
observed his daughter more times than one  i have observed her
today and i have observed her other days  i have observed her
in the court and i have observed her in the street by the prison
let me but lift my finger  she seemed to raise it the listeners
eyes were always on his paper and to let it fall with a rattle on
the ledge before her as if the axe had dropped

the citizeness is superb croaked the juryman

she is an angel said the vengeance and embraced her

as to thee pursued madame implacably addressing her husband
if it depended on theewhich happily it does notthou wouldst
rescue this man even now

no protested defarge  not if to lift this glass would do it
but i would leave the matter there  i say stop there

see you then jacques said madame defarge wrathfully and see
you too my little vengeance see you both  listen  for other crimes
as tyrants and oppressors i have this race a long time on my register
doomed to destruction and extermination  ask my husband is that so

it is so assented defarge without being asked

in the beginning of the great days when the bastille falls he
finds this paper of today and he brings it home and in the middle
of the night when this place is clear and shut we read it here on
this spot by the light of this lamp  ask him is that so

it is so assented defarge

that night i tell him when the paper is read through and the lamp
is burnt out and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and
between those iron bars that i have now a secret to communicate
ask him is that so

it is so assented defarge again

i communicate to him that secret  i smite this bosom with these two
hands as i smite it now and i tell him defarge i was brought up
among the fishermen of the seashore and that peasant family so
injured by the two evremonde brothers as that bastille paper describes
is my family  defarge that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon
the ground was my sister that husband was my sisters husband that
unborn child was their child that brother was my brother that
father was my father those dead are my dead and that summons to
answer for those things descends to me  ask him is that so

it is so assented defarge once more

then tell wind and fire where to stop returned madame but dont
tell me

both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature
of her wraththe listener could feel how white she was without
seeing herand both highly commended it  defarge a weak minority
interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of
the marquis but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her
last reply  tell the wind and the fire where to stop not me

customers entered and the group was broken up  the english customer
paid for what he had had perplexedly counted his change and asked
as a stranger to be directed towards the national palace
madame defarge took him to the door and put her arm on his in
pointing out the road  the english customer was not without his
reflections then that it might be a good deed to seize that arm
lift it and strike under it sharp and deep

but he went his way and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the
prison wall  at the appointed hour he emerged from it to present
himself in mr lorrys room again where he found the old gentleman
walking to and fro in restless anxiety  he said he had been with
lucie until just now and had only left her for a few minutes to
come and keep his appointment  her father had not been seen since
he quitted the bankinghouse towards four oclock  she had some
faint hopes that his mediation might save charles but they were very
slight  he had been more than five hours gone  where could he be

mr lorry waited until ten but doctor manette not returning and he
being unwilling to leave lucie any longer it was arranged that he
should go back to her and come to the bankinghouse again at midnight
in the meanwhile carton would wait alone by the fire for the doctor

he waited and waited and the clock struck twelve but doctor manette
did not come back  mr lorry returned and found no tidings of him
and brought none  where could he be

they were discussing this question and were almost building up some
weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence when they heard him
on the stairs  the instant he entered the room it was plain that
all was lost

whether he had really been to any one or whether he had been all
that time traversing the streets was never known  as he stood
staring at them they asked him no question for his face told them
everything

i cannot find it said he and i must have it  where is it

his head and throat were bare and as he spoke with a helpless look
straying all around he took his coat off and let it drop on the floor

where is my bench  i have been looking everywhere for my bench and
i cant find it  what have they done with my work  time presses
i must finish those shoes

they looked at one another and their hearts died within them

come come said he in a whimpering miserable way let me get
to work  give me my work

receiving no answer he tore his hair and beat his feet upon the
ground like a distracted child

dont torture a poor forlorn wretch he implored them with a dreadful
cry but give me my work  what is to become of us if those shoes are
not done tonight

lost utterly lost

it was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him or try to restore him
thatas if by agreementthey each put a hand upon his shoulder
and soothed him to sit down before the fire with a promise that he
should have his work presently  he sank into the chair and brooded
over the embers and shed tears  as if all that had happened since
the garret time were a momentary fancy or a dream mr lorry saw him
shrink into the exact figure that defarge had had in keeping

affected and impressed with terror as they both were by this
spectacle of ruin it was not a time to yield to such emotions
his lonely daughter bereft of her final hope and reliance appealed
to them both too strongly  again as if by agreement they looked at
one another with one meaning in their faces
carton was the first to speak

the last chance is gone  it was not much  yes he had better be
taken to her  but before you go will you for a moment steadily
attend to me  dont ask me why i make the stipulations i am going to
make and exact the promise i am going to exact i have a reasona
good one

i do not doubt it answered mr lorry  say on

the figure in the chair between them was all the time monotonously
rocking itself to and fro and moaning  they spoke in such a tone as
they would have used if they had been watching by a sickbed in the night

carton stooped to pick up the coat which lay almost entangling his feet
as he did so a small case in which the doctor was accustomed to
carry the lists of his days duties fell lightly on the floor
carton took it up and there was a folded paper in it  we should
look at this he said  mr lorry nodded his consent  he opened it
and exclaimed thank god

what is it asked mr lorry eagerly

a moment  let me speak of it in its place  first he put his hand
in his coat and took another paper from it that is the certificate
which enables me to pass out of this city  look at it  you see
sydney carton an englishman

mr lorry held it open in his hand gazing in his earnest face

keep it for me until tomorrow  i shall see him tomorrow
you remember and i had better not take it into the prison

why not

i dont know i prefer not to do so  now take this paper that
doctor manette has carried about him  it is a similar certificate
enabling him and his daughter and her child at any time to pass the
barrier and the frontier  you see

yes

perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against
evil yesterday  when is it dated  but no matter dont stay to look
put it up carefully with mine and your own  now observe  i never
doubted until within this hour or two that he had or could have
such a paper  it is good until recalled  but it may be soon recalled
and i have reason to think will be

they are not in danger

they are in great danger  they are in danger of denunciation by
madame defarge  i know it from her own lips  i have overheard words
of that womans tonight which have presented their danger to me in
strong colours  i have lost no time and since then i have seen the
spy  he confirms me  he knows that a woodsawyer living by the
prison wall is under the control of the defarges and has been
rehearsed by madame defarge as to his having seen herhe never
mentioned lucies namemaking signs and signals to prisoners
it is easy to foresee that the pretence will be the common one a
prison plot and that it will involve her lifeand perhaps her
childsand perhaps her fathersfor both have been seen with her
at that place  dont look so horrified  you will save them all

heaven grant i may carton  but how

i am going to tell you how  it will depend on you and it could
depend on no better man  this new denunciation will certainly not
take place until after tomorrow probably not until two or three
days afterwards more probably a week afterwards  you know it is a
capital crime to mourn for or sympathise with a victim of the
guillotine  she and her father would unquestionably be guilty of
this crime and this woman the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot
be described would wait to add that strength to her case and make
herself doubly sure  you follow me

so attentively and with so much confidence in what you say that
for the moment i lose sight touching the back of the doctors
chair even of this distress

you have money and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast
as quickly as the journey can be made  your preparations have been
completed for some days to return to england  early tomorrow have
your horses ready so that they may be in starting trim at two oclock
in the afternoon

it shall be done

his manner was so fervent and inspiring that mr lorry caught the
flame and was as quick as youth

you are a noble heart  did i say we could depend upon no better man
tell her tonight what you know of her danger as involving her
child and her father  dwell upon that for she would lay her own
fair head beside her husbands cheerfully  he faltered for an instant
then went on as before  for the sake of her child and her father
press upon her the necessity of leaving paris with them and you
at that hour  tell her that it was her husbands last arrangement
tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe or hope
you think that her father even in this sad state will submit
himself to her do you not

i am sure of it

i thought so  quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made
in the courtyard here even to the taking of your own seat in the
carriage  the moment i come to you take me in and drive away

i understand that i wait for you under all circumstances

you have my certificate in your hand with the rest you know
and will reserve my place  wait for nothing but to have my place
occupied and then for england

why then said mr lorry grasping his eager but so firm and
steady hand it does not all depend on one old man but i shall have
a young and ardent man at my side

by the help of heaven you shall  promise me solemnly that nothing
will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged
to one another

nothing carton

remember these words tomorrow  change the course or delay in
itfor any reasonand no life can possibly be saved and many
lives must inevitably be sacrificed

i will remember them  i hope to do my part faithfully

and i hope to do mine  now good bye

though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness and though he
even put the old mans hand to his lips he did not part from him
then  he helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the
dying embers as to get a cloak and hat put upon it and to tempt it
forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still
moaningly besought to have  he walked on the other side of it and
protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted
heartso happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own
desolate heart to itoutwatched the awful night  he entered the
courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone looking up at
the light in the window of her room  before he went away he
breathed a blessing towards it and a farewell

fiftytwo


in the black prison of the conciergerie the doomed of the day
awaited their fate  they were in number as the weeks of the year
fiftytwo were to roll that afternoon on the lifetide of the city to
the boundless everlasting sea  before their cells were quit of them
new occupants were appointed before their blood ran into the blood
spilled yesterday the blood that was to mingle with theirs tomorrow
was already set apart

two score and twelve were told off  from the farmergeneral of seventy
whose riches could not buy his life to the seamstress of twenty
whose poverty and obscurity could not save her  physical diseases
engendered in the vices and neglects of men will seize on victims
of all degrees and the frightful moral disorder born of unspeakable
suffering intolerable oppression and heartless indifference
smote equally without distinction

charles darnay alone in a cell had sustained himself with no
flattering delusion since he came to it from the tribunal in every
line of the narrative he had heard he had heard his condemnation
he had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly
save him that he was virtually sentenced by the millions and that
units could avail him nothing

nevertheless it was not easy with the face of his beloved wife
fresh before him to compose his mind to what it must bear  his hold
on life was strong and it was very very hard to loosen by gradual
efforts and degrees unclosed a little here it clenched the tighter
there and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it
yielded this was closed again  there was a hurry too in all his
thoughts a turbulent and heated working of his heart that contended
against resignation  if for a moment he did feel resigned then
his wife and child who had to live after him seemed to protest and
to make it a selfish thing

but all this was at first  before long the consideration that
there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet and that numbers went
the same road wrongfully and trod it firmly every day sprang up to
stimulate him  next followed the thought that much of the future
peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones depended on his quiet
fortitude  so by degrees he calmed into the better state when he
could raise his thoughts much higher and draw comfort down

before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation he had
travelled thus far on his last way  being allowed to purchase the
means of writing and a light he sat down to write until such time
as the prison lamps should be extinguished

he wrote a long letter to lucie showing her that he had known
nothing of her fathers imprisonment until he had heard of it from
herself and that he had been as ignorant as she of his fathers and
uncles responsibility for that misery until the paper had been read
he had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of
the name he had relinquished was the one conditionfully
intelligible nowthat her father had attached to their betrothal
and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their
marriage  he entreated her for her fathers sake never to seek to
know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the
paper or had had it recalled to him for the moment or for good
by the story of the tower on that old sunday under the dear old
planetree in the garden  if he had preserved any definite remembrance
of it there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with
the bastille when he had found no mention of it among the relics of
prisoners which the populace had discovered there and which had been
described to all the world  he besought herthough he added that he
knew it was needlessto console her father by impressing him
through every tender means she could think of with the truth that he
had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself but had
uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes  next to her
preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing and her
overcoming of her sorrow to devote herself to their dear child
he adjured her as they would meet in heaven to comfort her father

to her father himself he wrote in the same strain but he told her
father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care
and he told him this very strongly with the hope of rousing him
from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw
he might be tending

to mr lorry he commended them all and explained his worldly affairs
that done with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm
attachment all was done  he never thought of carton  his mind was
so full of the others that he never once thought of him

he had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out
when he lay down on his straw bed he thought he had done with this world

but it beckoned him back in his sleep and showed itself in shining
forms  free and happy back in the old house in soho though it had
nothing in it like the real house unaccountably released and light
of heart he was with lucie again and she told him it was all a dream
and he had never gone away  a pause of forgetfulness and then he
had even suffered and had come back to her dead and at peace and yet
there was no difference in him  another pause of oblivion and he
awoke in the sombre morning unconscious where he was or what had
happened until it flashed upon his mind this is the day of my death

thus had he come through the hours to the day when the fiftytwo
heads were to fall  and now while he was composed and hoped that
he could meet the end with quiet heroism a new action began in his
waking thoughts which was very difficult to master

he had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life
how high it was from the ground how many steps it had where he
would be stood how he would be touched whether the touching hands
would be dyed red which way his face would be turned whether he
would be the first or might be the last  these and many similar
questions in nowise directed by his will obtruded themselves over
and over again countless times  neither were they connected with
fear  he was conscious of no fear  rather they originated in a
strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came
a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to
which it referred a wondering that was more like the wondering of
some other spirit within his than his own

the hours went on as he walked to and fro and the clocks struck the
numbers he would never hear again  nine gone for ever ten gone for
ever eleven gone for ever twelve coming on to pass away  after a
hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last
perplexed him he had got the better of it  he walked up and down
softly repeating their names to himself  the worst of the strife was
over  he could walk up and down free from distracting fancies
praying for himself and for them

twelve gone for ever

he had been apprised that the final hour was three and he knew he
would be summoned some time earlier inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted
heavily and slowly through the streets  therefore he resolved to keep
two before his mind as the hour and so to strengthen himself in the
interval that he might be able after that time to strengthen others

walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast
a very different man from the prisoner who had walked to and fro at
la force he heard one struck away from him without surprise
the hour had measured like most other hours  devoutly thankful to
heaven for his recovered selfpossession he thought there is but
another now and turned to walk again

footsteps in the stone passage outside the door  he stopped

the key was put in the lock and turned  before the door was opened
or as it opened a man said in a low voice in english  he has never
seen me here i have kept out of his way  go you in alone i wait near
lose no time

the door was quickly opened and closed and there stood before him
face to face quiet intent upon him with the light of a smile on
his features and a cautionary finger on his lip sydney carton

there was something so bright and remarkable in his look that for
the first moment the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of
his own imagining  but he spoke and it was his voice he took the
prisoners hand and it was his real grasp

of all the people upon earth you least expected to see me he said

i could not believe it to be you  i can scarcely believe it now
you are notthe apprehension came suddenly into his minda prisoner

no  i am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers
here and in virtue of it i stand before you  i come from heryour
wife dear darnay

the prisoner wrung his hand

i bring you a request from her

what is it

a most earnest pressing and emphatic entreaty addressed to you in the
most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you that you well remember

the prisoner turned his face partly aside

you have no time to ask me why i bring it or what it means i have
no time to tell you  you must comply with ittake off those boots
you wear and draw on these of mine

there was a chair against the wall of the cell behind the
prisoner  carton pressing forward had already with the speed of
lightning got him down into it and stood over him barefoot

draw on these boots of mine  put your hands to them
put your will to them  quick

carton there is no escaping from this place it never can be done
you will only die with me  it is madness

it would be madness if i asked you to escape but do i  when i ask
you to pass out at that door tell me it is madness and remain here
change that cravat for this of mine that coat for this of mine
while you do it let me take this ribbon from your hair and shake
out your hair like this of mine

with wonderful quickness and with a strength both of will and action
that appeared quite supernatural he forced all these changes upon him
the prisoner was like a young child in his hands

carton  dear carton  it is madness  it cannot be accomplished
it never can be done it has been attempted and has always failed
i implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine

do i ask you my dear darnay to pass the door  when i ask that
refuse  there are pen and ink and paper on this table  is your hand
steady enough to write

it was when you came in

steady it again and write what i shall dictate  quick friend quick

pressing his hand to his bewildered head darnay sat down at the table
carton with his right hand in his breast stood close beside him

write exactly as i speak

to whom do i address it

to no one  carton still had his hand in his breast

do i date it

no

the prisoner looked up at each question  carton standing over him
with his hand in his breast looked down

if you remember said carton dictating the words that passed
between us long ago you will readily comprehend this when you see it
you do remember them i know  it is not in your nature to forget them

he was drawing his hand from his breast the prisoner chancing to
look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote the hand stopped closing
upon something

have you written forget them carton asked

i have  is that a weapon in your hand

no i am not armed

what is it in your hand

you shall know directly  write on there are but a few words more
he dictated again  i am thankful that the time has come when i
can prove them  that i do so is no subject for regret or grief
as he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer his hand
slowly and softly moved down close to the writers face

the pen dropped from darnays fingers on the table and he looked
about him vacantly

what vapour is that he asked

vapour

something that crossed me

i am conscious of nothing there can be nothing here  take up the
pen and finish  hurry hurry

as if his memory were impaired or his faculties disordered the
prisoner made an effort to rally his attention  as he looked at
carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing
cartonhis hand again in his breastlooked steadily at him

hurry hurry

the prisoner bent over the paper once more

if it had been otherwise cartons hand was again watchfully
and softly stealing down i never should have used the longer
opportunity  if it had been otherwise the hand was at the
prisoners face i should but have had so much the more to answer
for  if it had been otherwise  carton looked at the pen and saw
it was trailing off into unintelligible signs

cartons hand moved back to his breast no more  the prisoner sprang
up with a reproachful look but cartons hand was close and firm at
his nostrils and cartons left arm caught him round the waist
for a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come
to lay down his life for him but within a minute or so he was
stretched insensible on the ground

quickly but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was
carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside
combed back his hair and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had
worn  then he softly called enter there  come in and the spy
presented himself

you see said carton looking up as he kneeled on one knee beside
the insensible figure putting the paper in the breast  is your
hazard very great

mr carton the spy answered with a timid snap of his fingers
my hazard is not that in the thick of business here if you are
true to the whole of your bargain

dont fear me  i will be true to the death

you must be mr carton if the tale of fiftytwo is to be right
being made right by you in that dress i shall have no fear

have no fear  i shall soon be out of the way of harming you and the
rest will soon be far from here please god  now get assistance and
take me to the coach

you said the spy nervously

him man with whom i have exchanged  you go out at the gate by
which you brought me in

of course

i was weak and faint when you brought me in and i am fainter now
you take me out  the parting interview has overpowered me  such a
thing has happened here often and too often  your life is in your
own hands  quick  call assistance

you swear not to betray me said the trembling spy as he paused
for a last moment

man man returned carton stamping his foot have i sworn by no
solemn vow already to go through with this that you waste the
precious moments now  take him yourself to the courtyard you know of
place him yourself in the carriage show him yourself to mr lorry
tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air and to remember
my words of last night and his promise of last night and drive away

the spy withdrew and carton seated himself at the table resting his
forehead on his hands  the spy returned immediately with two men

how then said one of them contemplating the fallen figure  so
afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of
sainte guillotine

a good patriot said the other could hardly have been more
afflicted if the aristocrat had drawn a blank

they raised the unconscious figure placed it on a litter they had
brought to the door and bent to carry it away

the time is short evremonde said the spy in a warning voice

i know it well answered carton  be careful of my friend i
entreat you and leave me

come then my children said barsad  lift him and come away

the door closed and carton was left alone  straining his powers of
listening to the utmost he listened for any sound that might denote
suspicion or alarm  there was none  keys turned doors clashed
footsteps passed along distant passages  no cry was raised or hurry
made that seemed unusual  breathing more freely in a little while
he sat down at the table and listened again until the clock struck two

sounds that he was not afraid of for he divined their meaning then
began to be audible  several doors were opened in succession and
finally his own  a gaoler with a list in his hand looked in
merely saying follow me evremonde and he followed into a large
dark room at a distance  it was a dark winter day and what with
the shadows within and what with the shadows without he could but
dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms
bound  some were standing some seated  some were lamenting and in
restless motion but these were few  the great majority were silent
and still looking fixedly at the ground

as he stood by the wall in a dim corner while some of the fiftytwo
were brought in after him one man stopped in passing to embrace
him as having a knowledge of him  it thrilled him with a great
dread of discovery but the man went on  a very few moments after
that a young woman with a slight girlish form a sweet spare face
in which there was no vestige of colour and large widely opened
patient eyes rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting
and came to speak to him

citizen evremonde she said touching him with her cold hand
i am a poor little seamstress who was with you in la force

he murmured for answer  true  i forget what you were accused of

plots  though the just heaven knows that i am innocent of any
is it likely  who would think of plotting with a poor little weak
creature like me

the forlorn smile with which she said it so touched him that tears
started from his eyes

i am not afraid to die citizen evremonde but i have done nothing
i am not unwilling to die if the republic which is to do so much
good to us poor will profit by my death but i do not know how that
can be citizen evremonde  such a poor weak little creature

as the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to
it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl

i heard you were released citizen evremonde  i hoped it was true

it was  but i was again taken and condemned

if i may ride with you citizen evremonde will you let me hold your
hand  i am not afraid but i am little and weak and it will give me
more courage

as the patient eyes were lifted to his face he saw a sudden doubt in
them and then astonishment  he pressed the workworn hungerworn
young fingers and touched his lips

are you dying for him she whispered

and his wife and child  hush  yes

o you will let me hold your brave hand stranger

hush  yes my poor sister to the last



the same shadows that are falling on the prison are falling in that
same hour of the early afternoon on the barrier with the crowd about it
when a coach going out of paris drives up to be examined

who goes here  whom have we within  papers

the papers are handed out and read

alexandre manette  physician  french  which is he

this is he this helpless inarticulately murmuring wandering old
man pointed out

apparently the citizendoctor is not in his right mind
the revolutionfever will have been too much for him

greatly too much for him

hah  many suffer with it  lucie  his daughter  french  which is she

this is she

apparently it must be  lucie the wife of evremonde is it not

it is

hah  evremonde has an assignation elsewhere  lucie her child
english  this is she

she and no other

kiss me child of evremonde  now thou hast kissed a good
republican something new in thy family remember it  sydney carton
advocate  english  which is he

he lies here in this corner of the carriage  he too is pointed out

apparently the english advocate is in a swoon

it is hoped he will recover in the fresher air  it is represented
that he is not in strong health and has separated sadly from a
friend who is under the displeasure of the republic

is that all  it is not a great deal that  many are under the
displeasure of the republic and must look out at the little window
jarvis lorry  banker  english  which is he

i am he  necessarily being the last

it is jarvis lorry who has replied to all the previous questions
it is jarvis lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the
coach door replying to a group of officials  they leisurely walk
round the carriage and leisurely mount the box to look at what
little luggage it carries on the roof the countrypeople hanging
about press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in a
little child carried by its mother has its short arm held out for
it that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the
guillotine

behold your papers jarvis lorry countersigned

one can depart citizen

one can depart  forward my postilions  a good journey

i salute you citizensand the first danger passed

these are again the words of jarvis lorry as he clasps his hands
and looks upward  there is terror in the carriage there is weeping
there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller

are we not going too slowly  can they not be induced to go faster
asks lucie clinging to the old man

it would seem like flight my darling  i must not urge them too much
it would rouse suspicion

look back look back and see if we are pursued

the road is clear my dearest  so far we are not pursued

houses in twos and threes pass by us solitary farms ruinous
buildings dyeworks tanneries and the like open country avenues
of leafless trees  the hard uneven pavement is under us the soft
deep mud is on either side  sometimes we strike into the skirting
mud to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us sometimes we
stick in ruts and sloughs there  the agony of our impatience is then
so great that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and
runninghidingdoing anything but stopping

out of the open country in again among ruinous buildings solitary
farms dyeworks tanneries and the like cottages in twos and
threes avenues of leafless trees  have these men deceived us and
taken us back by another road  is not this the same place twice over
thank heaven no  a village  look back look back and see if we are
pursued  hush the postinghouse

leisurely our four horses are taken out leisurely the coach stands
in the little street bereft of horses and with no likelihood upon
it of ever moving again leisurely the new horses come into visible
existence one by one leisurely the new postilions follow sucking
and plaiting the lashes of their whips leisurely the old postilions
count their money make wrong additions and arrive at dissatisfied
results  all the time our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate
that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever
foaled

at length the new postilions are in their saddles and the old are
left behind  we are through the village up the hill and down the
hill and on the low watery grounds  suddenly the postilions
exchange speech with animated gesticulation and the horses are
pulled up almost on their haunches  we are pursued

ho  within the carriage there  speak then

what is it asks mr lorry looking out at window

how many did they say

i do not understand you

at the last post  how many to the guillotine today

fiftytwo

i said so  a brave number  my fellowcitizen here would have it
fortytwo ten more heads are worth having  the guillotine goes
handsomely  i love it  hi forward  whoop

the night comes on dark  he moves more he is beginning to revive
and to speak intelligibly he thinks they are still together he asks
him by his name what he has in his hand  o pity us kind heaven
and help us  look out look out and see if we are pursued

the wind is rushing after us and the clouds are flying after us and
the moon is plunging after us and the whole wild night is in pursuit
of us but so far we are pursued by nothing else



xiv

the knitting done


in that same juncture of time when the fiftytwo awaited their fate
madame defarge held darkly ominous council with the vengeance and
jacques three of the revolutionary jury  not in the wineshop did
madame defarge confer with these ministers but in the shed of the
woodsawyer erst a mender of roads  the sawyer himself did not
participate in the conference but abided at a little distance
like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required or to
offer an opinion until invited

but our defarge said jacques three is undoubtedly a good
republican  eh

there is no better the voluble vengeance protested in her shrill
notes in france

peace little vengeance said madame defarge laying her hand with
a slight frown on her lieutenants lips hear me speak  my husband
fellowcitizen is a good republican and a bold man he has deserved
well of the republic and possesses its confidence  but my husband
has his weaknesses and he is so weak as to relent towards this doctor

it is a great pity croaked jacques three dubiously shaking his
head with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth it is not quite
like a good citizen it is a thing to regret

see you said madame i care nothing for this doctor i  he may
wear his head or lose it for any interest i have in him it is all
one to me  but the evremonde people are to be exterminated and the
wife and child must follow the husband and father

she has a fine head for it croaked jacques three  i have seen
blue eyes and golden hair there and they looked charming when samson
held them up  ogre that he was he spoke like an epicure

madame defarge cast down her eyes and reflected a little

the child also observed jacques three with a meditative enjoyment
of his words has golden hair and blue eyes  and we seldom have a
child there  it is a pretty sight

in a word said madame defarge coming out of her short abstraction
i cannot trust my husband in this matter  not only do i feel since
last night that i dare not confide to him the details of my projects
but also i feel that if i delay there is danger of his giving warning
and then they might escape

that must never be croaked jacques three no one must escape
we have not half enough as it is  we ought to have six score a day

in a word madame defarge went on my husband has not my reason
for pursuing this family to annihilation and i have not his reason
for regarding this doctor with any sensibility  i must act for myself
therefore  come hither little citizen

the woodsawyer who held her in the respect and himself in the
submission of mortal fear advanced with his hand to his red cap

touching those signals little citizen said madame defarge
sternly that she made to the prisoners you are ready to bear
witness to them this very day

ay ay why not cried the sawyer  every day in all weathers
from two to four always signalling sometimes with the little one
sometimes without  i know what i know  i have seen with my eyes

he made all manner of gestures while he spoke as if in incidental
imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had
never seen

clearly plots said jacques three  transparently

there is no doubt of the jury inquired madame defarge letting her
eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile

rely upon the patriotic jury dear citizeness  i answer for my
fellowjurymen

now let me see said madame defarge pondering again  yet once more
can i spare this doctor to my husband  i have no feeling either way
can i spare him

he would count as one head observed jacques three in a low voice
we really have not heads enough it would be a pity i think

he was signalling with her when i saw her argued madame defarge
i cannot speak of one without the other and i must not be silent
and trust the case wholly to him this little citizen here
for i am not a bad witness

the vengeance and jacques three vied with each other in their fervent
protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses  the little citizen not to be outdone declared her to be
a celestial witness

he must take his chance said madame defarge  no i cannot spare
him  you are engaged at three oclock you are going to see the batch
of today executedyou

the question was addressed to the woodsawyer who hurriedly replied
in the affirmative  seizing the occasion to add that he was the most
ardent of republicans and that he would be in effect the most
desolate of republicans if anything prevented him from enjoying the
pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the
droll national barber  he was so very demonstrative herein that he
might have been suspected perhaps was by the dark eyes that looked
contemptuously at him out of madame defarges head of having his small
individual fears for his own personal safety every hour in the day

i said madame am equally engaged at the same place  after it is
oversay at eight tonightcome you to me in saint antoine and we
will give information against these people at my section

the woodsawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the
citizeness  the citizeness looking at him he became embarrassed
evaded her glance as a small dog would have done retreated among
his wood and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw

madame defarge beckoned the juryman and the vengeance a little nearer
to the door and there expounded her further views to them thus

she will now be at home awaiting the moment of his death  she will
be mourning and grieving  she will be in a state of mind to impeach
the justice of the republic  she will be full of sympathy with its
enemies  i will go to her

what an admirable woman what an adorable woman exclaimed
jacques three rapturously  ah my cherished cried the vengeance
and embraced her

take you my knitting said madame defarge placing it in her
lieutenants hands and have it ready for me in my usual seat
keep me my usual chair  go you there straight for there will
probably be a greater concourse than usual today

i willingly obey the orders of my chief said the vengeance with
alacrity and kissing her cheek  you will not be late

i shall be there before the commencement

and before the tumbrils arrive  be sure you are there my soul
said the vengeance calling after her for she had already turned
into the street before the tumbrils arrive

madame defarge slightly waved her hand to imply that she heard and
might be relied upon to arrive in good time and so went through the
mud and round the corner of the prison wall  the vengeance and the
juryman looking after her as she walked away were highly appreciative
of her fine figure and her superb moral endowments

there were many women at that time upon whom the time laid a
dreadfully disfiguring hand but there was not one among them more
to be dreaded than this ruthless woman now taking her way along the
streets  of a strong and fearless character of shrewd sense and
readiness of great determination of that kind of beauty which not
only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity but to
strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities the
troubled time would have heaved her up under any circumstances
but imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong and an
inveterate hatred of a class opportunity had developed her into a
tigress  she was absolutely without pity  if she had ever had the
virtue in her it had quite gone out of her

it was nothing to her that an innocent man was to die for the sins
of his forefathers she saw not him but them  it was nothing to her
that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan that
was insufficient punishment because they were her natural enemies
and her prey and as such had no right to live  to appeal to her
was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity even for herself
if she had been laid low in the streets in any of the many encounters
in which she had been engaged she would not have pitied herself
nor if she had been ordered to the axe tomorrow would she have
gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change
places with the man who sent here there

such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe  carelessly
worn it was a becoming robe enough in a certain weird way and her
dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap  lying hidden in her
bosom was a loaded pistol  lying hidden at her waist was a sharpened
dagger  thus accoutred and walking with the confident tread of such
a character and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
walked in her girlhood barefoot and barelegged on the brown
seasand madame defarge took her way along the streets

now when the journey of the travelling coach at that very moment
waiting for the completion of its load had been planned out last
night the difficulty of taking miss pross in it had much engaged
mr lorrys attention  it was not merely desirable to avoid
overloading the coach but it was of the highest importance that the
time occupied in examining it and its passengers should be reduced
to the utmost since their escape might depend on the saving of only
a few seconds here and there  finally he had proposed after anxious
consideration that miss pross and jerry who were at liberty to
leave the city should leave it at three oclock in the lightest
wheeled conveyance known to that period  unencumbered with luggage
they would soon overtake the coach and passing it and preceding it
on the road would order its horses in advance and greatly facilitate
its progress during the precious hours of the night when delay was
the most to be dreaded

seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency miss pross hailed it with joy  she and jerry had
beheld the coach start had known who it was that solomon brought
had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense and were now
concluding their arrangements to follow the coach even as madame
defarge taking her way through the streets now drew nearer and
nearer to the elsedeserted lodging in which they held their consultation

now what do you think mr cruncher said miss pross whose
agitation was so great that she could hardly speak or stand
or move or live  what do you think of our not starting from this
courtyard  another carriage having already gone from here today
it might awaken suspicion

my opinion miss returned mr cruncher is as youre right
likewise wot ill stand by you right or wrong

i am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures
said miss pross wildly crying that i am incapable of forming any
plan  are you capable of forming any plan my dear good mr cruncher

respectin a future spear o life miss returned mr cruncher
i hope so  respectin any present use o this here blessed old head
o mine i think not  would you do me the favour miss to take
notice o two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in
this here crisis

oh for gracious sake cried miss pross still wildly crying
record them at once and get them out of the way like an excellent man

first said mr cruncher who was all in a tremble and who spoke
with an ashy and solemn visage them poor things well out o this
never no more will i do it never no more

i am quite sure mr cruncher returned miss pross that you never
will do it again whatever it is and i beg you not to think it
necessary to mention more particularly what it is

no miss returned jerry it shall not be named to you  second
them poor things well out o this and never no more will i interfere
with mrs crunchers flopping never no more

whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be said miss pross
striving to dry her eyes and compose herself i have no doubt it
is best that mrs cruncher should have it entirely under her own
superintendenceo my poor darlings

i go so far as to say miss moreover proceeded mr cruncher with
a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpitand let my
words be took down and took to mrs cruncher through yourselfthat
wot my opinions respectin flopping has undergone a change and that
wot i only hope with all my heart as mrs cruncher may be a flopping
at the present time

there there there  i hope she is my dear man cried the distracted
miss pross and i hope she finds it answering her expectations

forbid it proceeded mr cruncher with additional solemnity
additional slowness and additional tendency to hold forth and hold
out as anything wot i have ever said or done should be wisited on
my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now  forbid it as we shouldnt
all flop if it was anyways conwenient to get em out o this here
dismal risk  forbid it miss  wot i say forbid it  this was
mr crunchers conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour
to find a better one

and still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came
nearer and nearer

if we ever get back to our native land said miss pross you may
rely upon my telling mrs cruncher as much as i may be able to remember
and understand of what you have so impressively said and at all
events you may be sure that i shall bear witness to your being
thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time  now pray let us think
my esteemed mr cruncher let us think

still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came
nearer and nearer

if you were to go before said miss pross and stop the vehicle
and horses from coming here and were to wait somewhere for me
wouldnt that be best

mr cruncher thought it might be best

where could you wait for me asked miss pross

mr cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but
temple bar  alas  temple bar was hundreds of miles away and madame
defarge was drawing very near indeed

by the cathedral door said miss pross  would it be much out of the
way to take me in near the great cathedral door between the two towers

no miss answered mr cruncher

then like the best of men said miss pross go to the posting
house straight and make that change

i am doubtful said mr cruncher hesitating and shaking his head
about leaving of you you see  we dont know what may happen

heaven knows we dont returned miss pross but have no fear for
me  take me in at the cathedral at three oclock or as near it as
you can and i am sure it will be better than our going from here
i feel certain of it  there  bless you mr cruncher  thinknot of
me but of the lives that may depend on both of us

this exordium and miss prosss two hands in quite agonised entreaty
clasping his decided mr cruncher  with an encouraging nod or two
he immediately went out to alter the arrangements and left her by
herself to follow as she had proposed

the having originated a precaution which was already in course of
execution was a great relief to miss pross  the necessity of
composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice
in the streets was another relief  she looked at her watch and it
was twenty minutes past two  she had no time to lose but must get
ready at once

afraid in her extreme perturbation of the loneliness of the
deserted rooms and of halfimagined faces peeping from behind every
open door in them miss pross got a basin of cold water and began
laving her eyes which were swollen and red  haunted by her feverish
apprehensions she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a
minute at a time by the dripping water but constantly paused and
looked round to see that there was no one watching her  in one of
those pauses she recoiled and cried out for she saw a figure
standing in the room

the basin fell to the ground broken and the water flowed to the feet
of madame defarge  by strange stern ways and through much staining
blood those feet had come to meet that water

madame defarge looked coldly at her and said the wife of evremonde
where is she

it flashed upon miss prosss mind that the doors were all standing
open and would suggest the flight  her first act was to shut them
there were four in the room and she shut them all  she then placed
herself before the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied

madame defarges dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement
and rested on her when it was finished  miss pross had nothing
beautiful about her years had not tamed the wildness or softened
the grimness of her appearance but she too was a determined woman
in her different way and she measured madame defarge with her eyes
every inch

you might from your appearance be the wife of lucifer said miss
pross in her breathing  nevertheless you shall not get the better
of me  i am an englishwoman

madame defarge looked at her scornfully but still with something of
miss prosss own perception that they two were at bay  she saw a
tight hard wiry woman before her as mr lorry had seen in the same
figure a woman with a strong hand in the years gone by  she knew
full well that miss pross was the familys devoted friend miss pross
knew full well that madame defarge was the familys malevolent enemy

on my way yonder said madame defarge with a slight movement of
her hand towards the fatal spot where they reserve my chair and my
knitting for me i am come to make my compliments to her in passing
i wish to see her

i know that your intentions are evil said miss pross and you may
depend upon it ill hold my own against them

each spoke in her own language neither understood the others words
both were very watchful and intent to deduce from look and manner
what the unintelligible words meant

it will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
moment said madame defarge  good patriots will know what that means
let me see her  go tell her that i wish to see her  do you hear

if those eyes of yours were bedwinches returned miss pross and
i was an english fourposter they shouldnt loose a splinter of me
no you wicked foreign woman i am your match

madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
detail but she so far understood them as to perceive that she was
set at naught

woman imbecile and piglike said madame defarge frowning
i take no answer from you  i demand to see her  either tell her
that i demand to see her or stand out of the way of the door and let
me go to her  this with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm

i little thought said miss pross that i should ever want to
understand your nonsensical language but i would give all i have
except the clothes i wear to know whether you suspect the truth or
any part of it

neither of them for a single moment released the others eyes
madame defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when miss
pross first became aware of her but she now advanced one step

i am a briton said miss pross i am desperate  i dont care an
english twopence for myself  i know that the longer i keep you here
the greater hope there is for my ladybird  ill not leave a handful
of that dark hair upon your head if you lay a finger on me

thus miss pross with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes
between every rapid sentence and every rapid sentence a whole breath
thus miss pross who had never struck a blow in her life

but her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
irrepressible tears into her eyes  this was a courage that madame
defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness  ha ha
she laughed you poor wretch  what are you worth  i address myself
to that doctor  then she raised her voice and called out citizen
doctor  wife of evremonde  child of evremonde  any person but this
miserable fool answer the citizeness defarge

perhaps the following silence perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of miss prosss face perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion whispered to madame defarge that they were gone
three of the doors she opened swiftly and looked in

those rooms are all in disorder there has been hurried packing
there are odds and ends upon the ground  there is no one in that
room behind you  let me look

never said miss pross who understood the request as perfectly as
madame defarge understood the answer

if they are not in that room they are gone and can be pursued and
brought back said madame defarge to herself

as long as you dont know whether they are in that room or not you
are uncertain what to do said miss pross to herself and you shall
not know that if i can prevent your knowing it and know that or
not know that you shall not leave here while i can hold you

i have been in the streets from the first nothing has stopped me
i will tear you to pieces but i will have you from that door said
madame defarge

we are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard
we are not likely to be heard and i pray for bodily strength to keep
you here while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand
guineas to my darling said miss pross

madame defarge made at the door  miss pross on the instinct of the
moment seized her round the waist in both her arms and held her
tight  it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and to strike
miss pross with the vigorous tenacity of love always so much
stronger than hate clasped her tight and even lifted her from the
floor in the struggle that they had  the two hands of madame defarge
buffeted and tore her face but miss pross with her head down held
her round the waist and clung to her with more than the hold of a
drowning woman

soon madame defarges hands ceased to strike and felt at her
encircled waist  it is under my arm said miss pross in smothered
tones you shall not draw it  i am stronger than you i bless
heaven for it  i hold you till one or other of us faints or dies

madame defarges hands were at her bosom  miss pross looked up saw
what it was struck at it struck out a flash and a crash and stood
aloneblinded with smoke

all this was in a second  as the smoke cleared leaving an awful
stillness it passed out on the air like the soul of the furious
woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground

in the first fright and horror of her situation miss pross passed
the body as far from it as she could and ran down the stairs to call
for fruitless help  happily she bethought herself of the
consequences of what she did in time to check herself and go back
it was dreadful to go in at the door again but she did go in and
even went near it to get the bonnet and other things that she must
wear  these she put on out on the staircase first shutting and
locking the door and taking away the key  she then sat down on the
stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry and then got up and
hurried away

by good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet or she could hardly
have gone along the streets without being stopped  by good fortune
too she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show
disfigurement like any other woman  she needed both advantages for
the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face and her hair was
torn and her dress hastily composed with unsteady hands was
clutched and dragged a hundred ways

in crossing the bridge she dropped the door key in the river
arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort and
waiting there she thought what if the key were already taken in a
net what if it were identified what if the door were opened and the
remains discovered what if she were stopped at the gate sent to
prison and charged with murder  in the midst of these fluttering
thoughts the escort appeared took her in and took her away

is there any noise in the streets she asked him

the usual noises mr cruncher replied and looked surprised by the
question and by her aspect

i dont hear you said miss pross  what do you say

it was in vain for mr cruncher to repeat what he said miss pross
could not hear him  so ill nod my head thought mr cruncher
amazed at all events shell see that  and she did

is there any noise in the streets now asked miss pross again
presently

again mr cruncher nodded his head

i dont hear it

gone deaf in an hour said mr cruncher ruminating with his mind
much disturbed wots come to her

i feel said miss pross as if there had been a flash and a crash
and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life

blest if she aint in a queer condition said mr cruncher more
and more disturbed  wot can she have been a takin to keep her
courage up  hark  theres the roll of them dreadful carts  you can
hear that miss

i can hear said miss pross seeing that he spoke to her
nothing  o my good man there was first a great crash and then a
great stillness and that stillness seems to be fixed and
unchangeable never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts

if she dont hear the roll of those dreadful carts now very nigh
their journeys end said mr cruncher glancing over his shoulder
its my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in
this world

and indeed she never did

the footsteps die out for ever


along the paris streets the deathcarts rumble hollow and harsh
six tumbrils carry the days wine to la guillotine  all the
devouring and insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could
record itself are fused in the one realisation guillotine  and yet
there is not in france with its rich variety of soil and climate
a blade a leaf a root a sprig a peppercorn which will grow to
maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced
this horror  crush humanity out of shape once more under similar
hammers and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms
sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again
and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind

six tumbrils roll along the streets  change these back again to what
they were thou powerful enchanter time and they shall be seen to
be the carriages of absolute monarchs the equipages of feudal nobles
the toilettes of flaring jezebels the churches that are not my
fathers house but dens of thieves the huts of millions of starving
peasants  no the great magician who majestically works out the
appointed order of the creator never reverses his transformations
if thou be changed into this shape by the will of god say the
seers to the enchanted in the wise arabian stories then remain so
but if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration then resume
thy former aspect  changeless and hopeless the tumbrils roll along

as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round they seem to plough
up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets  ridges
of faces are thrown to this side and to that and the ploughs go
steadily onward  so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses
to the spectacle that in many windows there are no people
and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended
while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils  here and there
the inmate has visitors to see the sight then he points his finger
with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent
to this cart and to this and seems to tell who sat here yesterday
and who there the day before

of the riders in the tumbrils some observe these things and all
things on their last roadside with an impassive stare others with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men  some seated with
drooping heads are sunk in silent despair again there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances
as they have seen in theatres and in pictures  several close their
eyes and think or try to get their straying thoughts together
only one and he a miserable creature of a crazed aspect is so
shattered and made drunk by horror that he sings and tries to
dance  not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture to
the pity of the people

there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils
and faces are often turned up to some of them and they are asked
some question  it would seem to be always the same question for
it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart
the horsemen abreast of that cart frequently point out one man in it
with their swords  the leading curiosity is to know which is he
he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down
to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart
and holds his hand  he has no curiosity or care for the scene about him
and always speaks to the girl  here and there in the long street
of st honore cries are raised against him  if they move him at all
it is only to a quiet smile as he shakes his hair a little more
loosely about his face  he cannot easily touch his face his arms
being bound

on the steps of a church awaiting the comingup of the tumbrils
stands the spy and prisonsheep  he looks into the first of them
not there  he looks into the second  not there  he already asks
himself has he sacrificed me when his face clears as he looks
into the third

which is evremonde says a man behind him

that  at the back there

with his hand in the girls

yes

the man cries down evremonde  to the guillotine all aristocrats
down evremonde

hush hush the spy entreats him timidly

and why not citizen

he is going to pay the forfeit  it will be paid in five minutes more
let him be at peace

but the man continuing to exclaim down evremonde the face of
evremonde is for a moment turned towards him  evremonde then sees
the spy and looks attentively at him and goes his way

the clocks are on the stroke of three and the furrow ploughed among
the populace is turning round to come on into the place of execution
and end  the ridges thrown to this side and to that now crumble in
and close behind the last plough as it passes on for all are following
to the guillotine  in front of it seated in chairs as in a garden
of public diversion are a number of women busily knitting  on one
of the foremost chairs stands the vengeance looking about for her
friend

therese she cries in her shrill tones  who has seen her
therese defarge

she never missed before says a knittingwoman of the sisterhood

no nor will she miss now cries the vengeance petulantly
therese
